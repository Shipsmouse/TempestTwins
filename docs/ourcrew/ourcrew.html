			<h1>Our Crew Members So Far.</h1><br />Vampirates are not what they seem, neither are people on the internet.  Therefore the Tempest Twins site has elected not to use real names.  If you wish to contact us (via the squeak page), you will be prompted for your character name.  This name will be listed here and only that person can use it, in connection with the same email address, to submit anything to be posted here.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>The Captain<br />He is someone who keeps us following his every word.  Captains command because of skill, daring, and the ability to win prizes and booty. They lead with a voice of ultimate authority.  In some cases pirate ships elected their Captains through a vote. If the Captain fell out of favour the crew were just as quick to maroon them, throw them overboard, or perhaps if they were lucky the crew would just let them off at the nearest port.  The Captain didn't have the last say, except in the midst of battle.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mouse" src="files/mouse.jpg" width="41" height="41" /></div>Fred the Ship's Mouse, Powder Monkey Black William Flint and Swabbie Calico Bess Flint.<br />I am the Quartermaster (Lieutenant or second in command) and I also manage this website.  My two pinkys are Powder Monkey Black William Flint and Swabbie Calico Bess Flint.  The Quartermaster is almost the Captain's equal, during times of battle the Captain has ultimate authority, but at all other times he and the crew were under the command of the Quartermaster.  Their duty was to represent the crews interests and enforce discipline at sea.  A powder monkey refers to a child who ran the gunpowder to the cannons during battle.  A swabbie or swab was a crew member who mopped the decks using a swab.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/thenocturn/index.htm" rel="self" title="The Nocturn"><img class="imageStyle" alt="ship" src="files/ship.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>The Nocturn<br />The Nocturn is the Captain of the original Vampirates fan website, The Nocturn.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><a href="http://snow-white-king.deviantart.com/" rel="self" title="snow-white-king.deviantart.com"><img class="imageStyle" alt="evilbroccoli" src="files/evilbroccoli.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>Adamescence<br />A member of the Deviant Art community.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/twilightfanheaven/index.htm" rel="self" title="twilight fan heaven"><img class="imageStyle" alt="ducks foot" src="files/duckfoot.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>Boatswain Duck's Foot Darcy<br />"Darcy preys on those she sees as pointless to society, as well as the odd superstitious maniac wielding a wooden cross and a clove of garlic. Darcy was captain of The Hellraiser; a mysterious galleon lurking in the shadows of overcast clouds, with sails of sin and rudders of rebellion. The Hellraiser was home to the rejects of society. Werewolves, ghosts, witches, vampires, stoned imps; you name it, the Hellraiser had it. Long ago, Darcy had a relationship with Mosh Zu Kamal, but he left her broken-hearted when he decided to run the Sanctuary and ration his meals instead of living like a true vampire. As a result, Darcy joined forces with the King of the Renegades; Sidorio. Enchanted by every essence of his aura, Darcy tries her best to impress Sidorio, but to no avail. Despite seeming like an evil such-and-such, deep down Darcy is a kind vampire with a broken heart and a strong bloodlust."  "I realised I don't have a job on the ship :/ I do have an unhealthy obsession with being clean and tidy and organised! :)".  Boatswain (bosun or bos'un) - ship's officer in charge of maintenance of the vessel, rigging and sails, and sometimes also third or fourth mate right under the Quartermaster.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mop" src="files/mop.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Cabin Girl<br />"I love the books and the the latest, Blood Captain, has left me crying out for more news about the twins and their adventures!"

Kataya Gray (born October 6, 1889 - died December 25, 1907 by murder) is a person that likes to keep to herself, and enjoys the silence.  Mostly using her time to expand her mind by extensive reading.  Has occasions where she will just want to be around people, and will come out of her shell.  Kataya has a distinct dislike for Christmas, for that is the day she was brutally murdered for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  She has come to terms with her death, but feels extremely uneasy about it when mentioned.  Kataya finds her solace in the peaceful night, and loves watching the stars.  Wakeman is a name for someone that stays up all night to keep watch over the ship."<br /><br />Lizzie Furey<br />But Cap'n Lizzie Furey on her own ship.  "My crossing was quick I was bitten by a Exiled Vampirate.

Well, this is my crossing story.  I lived in the 1500s and was good friends with a girl named alezandra. I was friends with her because we both had way too much imagination.   She used to tell me stories of how her father, her only family, was a vampire. She would never actually tell me who her father was, though.<br /><br />Than, one night, I was over at her house, teasing her about how she was home schooled and was going to die of social deprivation. As far as I knew, besides me and her father, she was alone all of the time.  Than, she stopped joking with me and started shoving my things into my back pack,"go, go, go"! she told me, practically pushing me out of the door."My dads home early"! And I died.<br /><br />I found out later that Alazandra's dad had come up behind us and grabbed me. Lets leave it at 'I was dinner'. Oh, and I also found out who Alazandra's dad was.<br />    Count Dracula.<br />I am still fourteen and a half, and I am still Great friends with Alazandra. We live as roomates on THE NOCTURNE. Not her dad though.  He was killed by the townspeople when he refused to come out in the sunlight to the police at the door, they forced him out. Alazandra only barely escaped.  And my name?  Alazandra started calling me Apple after my crossing. Than I became Midshipman on THE NOCTURNE. I have been called Apple so long now, I have forgotten my real name."<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="black bart" src="files/blackbart.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Notorious Black Bart's Daughter.<br />A member of the Nocturn and also found contributing on the Blue Peter Blog.  From Wikipedia - Born John Roberts (May 17, 1682 - February 10, 1722), Bartholomew Roberts, also known as Bart Roberts, was a Welsh pirate who raided shipping off the Americas and West Africa between 1719 and 1722. He was the most successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy, capturing far more ships than some of the best-known pirates of this era such as Blackbeard or Captain Kidd. He is estimated to have captured over 470 vessels. He is also known as Black Bart (Welsh: Barti Ddu), but this name was never used in his lifetime.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="buns" src="files/sq_buns.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Nugglebuns<br />"I'm actually best friends with Bob Lea.

I am Quarxphonix , the uber-vampirate nerd and a proud member of this crew. I love sitting writing odd little stories of what will happen next in the books, but that doesn't mean I have to stop doing my job (it's pretty hard being a sailor sometimes!) Anyways I hope you guys enjoy this website and the vampirates series. Trust the tide!"<br /><br />Sailor Vanderdecken<br />The Captain of the Flying Dutchman is called Van der Decken (meaning of the decks). Sources disagree on whether "Flying Dutchman" was the name of the ship, or a nickname for her captain.  The Flying Dutchman, according to folklore, is a ghost ship that can never go home, and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The Flying Dutchman is usually spotted from afar, sometimes seen to be glowing with ghostly light. It is said that if she is hailed by another ship, her crew will often try to send messages to land or to people long since dead.  In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is reckoned by seafarers to be a portent of doom.<br /><br />Sailor Vickyy<br />I love reading Vampirates.

Just call me Sarah. I'm a lagger on THE NOCTURNE. I was born 1803, same age as Lorcan, only I was sired when I was 16 in London. I was sired(turned vampire) when I was 16 by my Science teacher. I was killed by my ex-boyfriend slitting my throat after embarrassing him at the school.  The captain found me in London after I turned on my teacher after he wanted me to do dirty work for him by the school. I LOVE the captain for saving me.  I'm a lover of Halloween and now I am the one who sets the Halloween Feast on the ship. My donor's name is William. (I have a thing for him for about 200yrs now) SSSHHH!!!!!. I know it's wrong. I''l talk more later".  "I'm, of course, new to the crew and I'm a fan of Lorcan and can't wait until Blood Caption comes out in my area on March, 26th."<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="bookworm" src="files/bookworm.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Sea Artist, Irish Bookworm Cartographer<br />A member of the Pirate Academy.   The Sea Artist, Navigator or Sailing Master  is in charge of sailing the ship, by reading and correcting maps / charts and using navigational tools. Possessing such knowledge often would make a person the Second Mate if he were not already the First Mate or Captain.  The surname Cartographer means map maker.<br /><br />Silver Ribbon Turning<br />I am a vampirates fanatic, craving for the next installment of Black Heart. Justin Somper  had combined my two greatest addictions. I have always held a slightly above average interest in vampires, i guess some would say. In recenter years, though before my discovery of the Vampirates books, i have become to see the glorified life of a pirate tempting...as i am sure young master Tempest would agree. For now my eyes search the seas and hope that night comes swiftly carrying our kindly vampires and pirates on the tides.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="bolinus brandaris" src="files/bolinusbrandaris.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Surgeon Tyrian Furey<br />"Hey, wow this is such a cool site Vampirates rule!!! ...

Tyrian purple is also known as royal purple or imperial purple  It is an expensive purple-red dye which was first produced by the ancient Phoenicians in the city of Tyre.  Tyrian purple is harvested from fresh mucus secretion from the hypobranchial gland of a Bolinus brandaris sea snail.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="gladiator" src="files/gladiator.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>TerrorLies Mourning<br />aaaack it should so be a movie!!!!
