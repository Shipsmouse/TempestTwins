			<h1>ONLY READ ON, IF YOU HAVE READ Blood Captain, AS THIS PAGE WILL SPOIL THE STORY.This section is now closed.</h1><br /><br /><div class="image-left"><a href="http://nocturn1.proboards56.com/index.cgi" rel="external" title="http://nocturn1.proboards56.com/index.cgi"><img class="imageStyle" alt="treasure" src="files/treasure.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>The Nocturn Forum still has this section open.<br /> <a href="http://nocturn1.proboards56.com/index.cgi" rel="self" title="The Nocturn Forum">nocturn1.proboards56.com/index.cgi</a><br /><br />From Playground<br />i think that lorcan might be the twins biological father...even tho i want to see grace and him together.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="apple" src="files/apple.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Midshipman Apple<br />i think that grace and conner should be part vampire. i mean, that would explain why their better at lots of things then other kids their age. sally COULD be a vampire, and she told lorcon that if they ever ended up on the vampirate ship, he was to protect them. that wouldnt explain how she ended up kinda BEING the captain tho... i'll have to think on that one...<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="apple" src="files/apple.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Midshipman Apple<br />I think Grace will go with Conner to Cheng-Li's crew, to be with conner and give Lorcan a tast of what he wanted.(her gone) Lorcon, seeing he can't live without her, goes and gets her, leading to their mysterious "talk". In it, they will discus how they like each other, so grace points out the obvious solution, change her. when Lorcon absolutely refuses, she pretends to kill herself, things, will go wrong, and she almost dies. Hero-Lorcon will save her of course, but when she learns she survives, she goes to sidorio, he drinks her blood, killing her, and changes her and gets her to join his crew. Lorcon runs in, and wipes out sidorio, but johny D. takes her hostage and only sally can save her. in the process of rescuation, grace hits her head, and suddenly FORGETS EVERYTHING!!! she forces conner to go back to crescent moon bay, where she suddenly starts remembering, but only the details that lead to why Dexter took care of them and solves the mystery, and only remembers EVERYTHING when the boat-wreck of history repeats itself and once more finds herself staring up into lorcons eyes. then all of chen-li's crew and conner become vampirates and so kick whats left of Sidorio's crew's BUTT!!!!!!!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampire" src="files/vampire.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From BellaXGraceXLove<br />I think lady kraus and sailor black dragon are on to something.  How about there is a fight, but grace gets caught in between it and sidorio stabs her. Conner tries to fight him off while lorcan tries to keep grace alive but then he has to turn her into a vampire and just before sidorio is about to kill conner too, grace comes in and saves him!!(smart girls like grace are sooo awesome) and then they live happily ever after with each other . . . or something like that  . . .<br /><br />From Lady Kaus<br />I think that grace is going to turn into a vampirate and lorcan and grace r goin to get married<br /><br />From Grace_Tempest_Is_Me<br />i think that the captain is going 2 b their dad coz he always lokkes after them as if he loves them. i think lorcan and grace will finally admit that they are inlove and get together. well if they don't i'm gonna cry coz it's really annoying how they never own up 2 it!!!!! i think grace should die but get turned into a vampire so she and lorcan can b together 4 eva!!!! but where would that leave connor...i'm confused!!!! is grace gonna pick lorcan or connor????<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="dragon" src="files/dragon.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Black Dragon<br />What is going to happen to Sidorio? A big ship battle would be awesome!!  By the way, if the vampirate captain dissapeared and they didn't find him, is Lorcan captain now?!  Captain Furey,that sure has a ring to it.  I REALLY hope Justin Somper reads this.<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="dragon" src="files/dragon.jpg" width="40" height="40" />From Sailor Black Dragon<br />I think we should hear Lorcans crossing story. I'll bet it's interesting. This subject has been nagging at the back of my head since I started reading Vampirates.<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait.jpg" width="40" height="40" />From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I think that the pirate captain is Conner and Grace dad because conner can read thoughs of people before a fight just like the pirate captain does. So i feel that maybe his there dad or related in some way.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Amazon.co.uk<br />Black Heart Synopsis<br />There's a new ship of vampirates roaming the seas, leaving a trail of fear and devastation in its wake. When a high-profile pirate is slain, the Pirate Federation takes decisive action and begins training up a ship of dedicated vampire hunters. The team will be led by newly appointed Captain, Cheng Li. Amongst her dynamic crew is young pirate prodigy Connor Tempest. Meanwhile, Connor's twin sister Grace enjoys a bittersweet reunion with their mother. Sally Tempest has some important and shocking news for Grace - the twins' real father is not the man who brought them up. When Sally disappears, Grace is left to pursue the mystery of her true parenthood alone. As she finally uncovers the shocking truth, she knows that both she and Connor are facing a very uncertain future.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirekiss" src="files/vampirekiss.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>From Magie The Vampirate<br />At book 3 the last "act" was where Lorcan and Grace and Connor and Sally where having a group hug in a mist... because i know that Graces and Connors mother was dead when they were born and that Lorcan was crossed when he was 16 in 1820... this means that if Sally had any connection with Lorcan it would be after his cross and before her death right? this means that they are nat relatives! pheww!!!!  I think that Sally may have saved Lorcans life once and afterwards Lorcan saved her children somehow. the twins father could have been friend to the captain and Lorcan. and also it could be possible that Sally was never dead and she is somewhere safe cos the captain is said to be a soul keeper how could the captain still hold a soul who's body is now ashes??????<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Misstress of the dark" src="files/misstressofthedark.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Felavria Vampire<br />Oooooh I like the idea about 'uncle vampirate captin' but why would Dexter have been singing them the shanty about how awful and scary the vampire captin and his ship is? Unless of course he didn't know Sally was related to the Vampirate captin, and he didn't belive the ship was real. Did Sally know that her brother was a vampire even?<br /><br />Also a couple of random things that has always bugged me about the books, what the hecky is the sails and the vampirate captains cloak made of?! some weird vampirate material only available in a vamp-land fabric shop? And does the vampirate captain have a name? Cos its a bit of a mouthful and its annoying having to type the whole thing out a million times.<br /><br />But even more confusing : Why does the vampire wear a veil (or mask) 'so as to curtail your fright'??? When the mask was removed at the end of Blood Captain I'm sure it said he pretty normal looking and just had a scar. I always expected him to look really creepy, so that was always a bit confusing!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="adder" src="files/adder.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Black Adder<br />My first thought on the next book would have been that Lorcan was Sally's brother in-law (twins uncle) but that would spoil the whole Lorcan and Grace romance so maybe sally was Lorcan's donor (which explains the connection for the captain to take on Sally's soul) then Dexter somehow found the ship fell in love with Sally they went off to Crescent Moon Bay not realising that she would age quicker then on her death bed after giving birth she told Dexter to take the babies to lorcan so he new when Dexter died he should look after them. As for Sidorio i think he and Connor should have a spar, Sidorio is on the brink of killing Connor when enters hero Lorcan but Sidorio escapes.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="black bart" src="files/blackbart.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Notorious Black Bart's Daughter<br />Hey, I've just got another idea. On the blue peter blog a girl on it asked Justin if Dexter tempest is actually the Vampirate captain and i'm thinking that could be a possibility!! The captain hides his face and voice so that MAYBE he doesn't want Grace or Conner knowing his true identity. And we don't really know how dexter died and we don't yet know about the mysterious captain nor his past! so maybe in the next book we might find out a little bit more about the captain and Grace and Conner's parents, now with Sally in the book, we could. So i'm hoping!!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="chest" src="files/chest.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Quarxphonix<br />Gosh , gosh , gosh. After book three my head is full of ideas.  Of course I'm desperate to know what is going on with the Twin's Mother. Blood Captain was left at such a cliff hanger don't you think??<br /><br />I'd like to see the whole story behind Lorcan and Sally. My only guess is that Sally was a donor , or a vampire on board the Nocturn (heck she could've been an inbetween). It would explain why Lorcan knew her in the first place (although how Dexter found the ship to meet her as somewhat more confusing!).<br /><br />I'm dying to see what's next in store for Lorcan and Grace (sorry, I'm extremely gushy about those two characters! Hopeless romantic that I am). And I'm praying Grace'll go back on the Nocturn.<br /><br />But most of all I can't wait to see what's going on with Sidorio and his new crew. I think Sidorio may have a little score to settle with our Grace..(and of course Johnny I imagine would be quite keen on getting his hands on Grace again). So that'd be interesting.<br /><br />Really I have no real idea whats coming up next...but I can't wait to find out!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="bubbles" src="files/bubbles.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor bubblemoon66<br />I think that Sally Tempest was the captain's sister (which would make sense when Connor shakes the Captain's hand as he would be their uncle & he was certain that it was a hand he had held before & it would also explain why the cabin next to the captains was empty) and that Lorcan was in love with her until Dexter left Crescent Moon Bay and joined the Nocturne (maybe as Sally's Donor?) I'm guessing Sally was attacked and killed or in pain, and Lorcan helped Dexter get the twins away. I don't think that the twins will stay with Sally; Connor will probably join Cheng Li and Grace will either return to the nocturne, join Connor (just for a while, maybe to spite Lorcan about him telling her to leave, though probably not) or leave to do some mysterious job for Mosh Zu. I couldn't see her staying in Sanctuary if everyone else leaves.  My guess is that Sidorio is also going to want revenge on Captain Wrathe and Connor will try to save all of his friends. I'm also guessing (ok, hoping) that Grace and Lorcan will end up together but I don't think that's the last of Johnny either.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="black bart" src="files/blackbart.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Notorious Black Bart's Daughter<br />My theory on the next book is that when Sally was younger she must've been a Dexter's donor (I think he might of) and that Lorcan fell in love with her but she grow up.  That might be a possibility but i wont hold my breath.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mouse" src="files/mouse.jpg" width="41" height="41" /></div>From Ship's Mouse<br />I hope the first chapter has Lorcan, Grace and Connor telling Sally their story so far.  So the twins hear how they ended up in Crescent Moon Bay.  I believe Dexter was Sally's donor and Lorcan helped Dexter get them there.  Also if Lorcan hears Grace's story, since leaving the Nocturne first time, he may realise the connection is stronger than he thought, as I believe he is unaware of her feeling his pain on her first trip.  Also he does not know about Grace's life being in danger the second out of the three times.  Seeing as Lorcan keeps trying to be romantic it would be just up this street (try deck), to surprise Grace by slipping behind her and when the story finishes give her a hug.  Apology too would be wonderful but I cannot see that happening.  If Connor can see the thoughts of others while sparring/fighting then may be Lorcan better offer to spar with Connor.  As for Sidorio I think the Vampirate Captain holds the key to his demise but I will wait till the last book for that.  I also think Connor, Jacoby and Jasmine are all set to join Cheng Li crew and become the new three Buccaneers although they will probably have a different name.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mouse" src="files/mouse.jpg" width="41" height="41" /></div>From Ship's Mouse<br />I have a question for you all.  What happens when it gets to that time of the month for Grace now she is living closer to the Vampirates?  I know after giving birth, when I was breast feeding my kids I lost the curse and it is common for the female body to lose it when under stress.  So the donors have probably lost the curse and so it is not a problem on the Nocturne.  But what about Grace?<br />
