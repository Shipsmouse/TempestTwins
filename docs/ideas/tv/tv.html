			<h1>Should Vampirates Be A Film Or TV Series?</h1><br /><br /><h2>At the Windsor Festival Justin Somper hinted that he had been approached about Vampirates being an animated TV series.</h2><br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>On The Blue Peter Blog Justin asked:<br />'Vampirates' into a movie. I want to hear your views on books vs movies. Do you enjoy seeing your fave books like Stormbreaker, Harry Potter and Narnia being made into movies? Do the movies live up to the books? Are the movies a good representation of the books for fans coming to the story fresh? Does a not-so-great movie put you off going back to the books? Your thoughts on this subject please!<br /><br /><h5>So what are your views? please send via the contact (squeak) page.</h5><br /><div class="image-right"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Black Bart" src="files/blackbart.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h5>For soundtrack ideas, please see below the <a href="../../ideas/dolphin/dolphin.html" rel="self" title="Dirty Dolphin">Dirty Dolphin's jukebox</a>.  The soundtrack idea is from Notorious Black Barts Daughter. "If vampirate ever become a movie these will be their soundtracks!!".  For actors to play characters see under the <a href="../../ideas/lookalikes/lookalikes.html" rel="self" title="Lookalikes">lookalikes</a> page.</h5><br /><br /><div class="image-right"><a href="../../justin/bluepeter/bluepeter.html" rel="self" title="Blue Peter Blog"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Blue Peter" src="files/bluepeter.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div><h5>The oldest entries are from the <a href="#bluepeter">Blue Peter Blog</a>.  There is also <a href="../../ideas/tv/trailers/trailers.html" rel="self" title="Trailers">fans trailers on YouTube</a> and there is always <a href="http://www.piratebaystudios.com/vampirates/about.htm" rel="self" title="http://www.piratebaystudios.com/vampirates/about.htm">http://www.piratebaystudios.com/vampirates/about.htm</a>.</h5><br /><br />From Sailer Meem<br />I would love to see my most favorite books in the world made into a movie. No book ever touched my heart as much as Justin Somper's Vampirates did. If there i a movie, I'm definitely going to audition for it. Just like Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga, Vampirates is amazing, only better. My friends and I are waiting for someone to announce that they are going to make a movie of Vampirates. I greatly hope that you accept mine and other people's respond to your message in the previous page that we really desire a movie of Vampirates, not a TV show. Thank you for your consideration.<br /><br />From Sailer Jasmine<br />Making the books into films would be absolutely amazing!!! If you think about how films like Harry Potter, Narnia etc. They've all just made the books a LOT more popular. They also inspire nationwide readers. It also looks like a lot of your fans Justin know what they want, so why don't you take a risk, and be spontaneous. Take the plunge!!<br /><br />From  Sailor daldal<br />i love the idea. I often \'vision\' what it would be like as a movie. And it is FREACKING AWSOME. the directors i would think of to do the movie is the guy who does Twlight, James Camron, Peter Jackson, or  Tim burton(more of a chance Johnny Depp would be in it).<br /><br />From Sailor Grace<br />YES YES you should sooooo make this into a movie but have more than just 5 are and are you going to have another book like mabey show more of the future for the pirates and grace and lorcans future?!?!?!? your the best auther ever lol<br /><br />From Sailor Rebekah<br />Vampirates would make a great film it has action, adventure, romance AND fantasy. I would definately pay to see it <br /><br />From Sailor Cyla<br />I was just wondering if Vampirates would be made into a film. I have alot of people tell me I look like Grace, and if I could, I would like to audition for the part of Grace. Although I am only 13 (on September first) I think I could play a roll of a 14-yeard- old very well.<br /><br />From Lookout<br />Should definatly be made into a movie. A tv series would just go on and on. However i will always read the books reguardless of what you decide, captain somper<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />It would be way bigger than Pirates of the Carribean. DO IT!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="crowsnest" src="files/crowsnest.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Chlotsuintha Ague<br />Anyway, I've been hearing rumor of a movie; Vampirates? I loved the books and it would be great if there was a movie! <br /><br />From Lorcan 4ever<br />the series should totally become a movie series im in the middle of black heart right now and i love them soooooo much there would just have to be a great director like tim burton or drew barrimore and a good casting director new found talents would be best so people wouldnt judge the movies on whos in it. it might also be a question as to where the seens are shot i think in an actual ocean not in some green screen room. i know that if they were made into a movie that they would be good but NOT A TV SERIES, because it need to end somewhere not just keep going.<br /><br />From Sailor Link123<br />film defo!?<br /><br />From Sailor Yoko<br />Trully i think VAmpirates should be a movie. It is really not up to me but it is up to Captin Somper. I just hope he does this.<br /><br />From Sailor Snowy Star<br />I would love the vampirates books to be turned into a movie!   The harry potter series were great and stormbreaker was awesome, so i guess that this will be great too.<br /><br />From Sailor Darker<br />ok i soooooooooooo think vampirates should be a movie.  Because even if the movies turn out bad its gonna draw people to the books to see if they are good or not.<br /><br />From Mrs. Furey<br />Omg a Vampirate Movie would b awesome!!!! And on Justin's blog it actually seems to me tht it really might happen.<br /><br />From Sailor Aurelia<br />I think "vampirates" should be a movie, but I noticed that in all 4 books, there was a specific rating in each book even though it is a book grade 6+.I think books 1-2 could be PG for a lot of avtion and fighting stunts and a little bit of blood images.  Stunts and books 3-4 could be PG-13 for lots of disturbing blood images and mild gore and lots of bloody murders and (from my opinion from the blood bath scene in black heart) mild brief nudity.<br /><br />From Sailor Vickyy<br />I love reading Vampirates. Can't wait for the 5th book to come out after Black Heart. Not keen on the cover of the new book but defo make it into a film..i love it. It would receive lots of fans and profit (Y) Go for it!! Trust the Tide (Y)<br /><br />From Sailor Aurelia a Nocturne crew mate<br />I think "vampirates" should be a movie,but I noticed that in all 4 books, there was a specific rating in each book even though it is a book grade 6+.I think books 1-2 could be PG for alot of avtion and fighting stunts and a little bit of blood images. stunts and books 3-4 could be PG-13 for lots of disturbing blood images and mild gore and lots of bloody murders and (from my opinion from the blood bath scene in black heart)mild brief nudity.<br /><br />From Sailor Dead Dead<br />Vampirates sould be movie because in would be wired if it was a cartoon.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />i think vampirates should be a MOVIE!!i love Vampirates!! <br />Vampirates are my favorite books! i really think it should be a movie<br /><br />From Sailor Cat<br />I am writing my opinion on whether Vampirates should by made into a film or tv show. I most definetly think that it should be made into a non animated film, where you should be there while filming to make sure it is the same as the book. A tv show I think would ruin the series but a movie is a good idea.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-3.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I love reading Vampirates. Can't wait for the 5th book to come out after Black Heart. Not keen on the cover of the new book but defo make it into a film..i love it. It would receive lots of fans and profit (Y) Go for it!! Trust the Tide (Y)<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-4.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I think that Vampirates should definately become a movie because then more people will know about it. More people will start reading the books like with twilight and even if the film turns out lame, as long as the books are amzing in my point of view, nothing else matters!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="apple" src="files/apple.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Midshipman Apple<br />I think vampirates should stay a book. Cuz, what if they make it as bad as the twilight movie??? Horrible choice actors, the best parts turned corny, almost completely different story-line, and bad special effects with even worse script? No way No how.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-5.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I think it would make a great movie as long as they dont leave anything out like they do with Harry Potter, I would go see that movie!<br /><br />From Sailor Addie<br />I think Vampirats would make a great movie... I love the books. I love the story of the books & i bet more people would love seeing the movie... I think its a good idea!!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="ring" src="files/ring.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor LorcanXGrace<br />I Think It should be a real life movie, because some movies today are quite good, but if they got justin into the actual studio and asked if they could change anything I'm hoping he'll say no, because vampirates is a hit already with the books, and people have loved it so much theres no reason to change it. Plus, if they get an UGLY irish actor to play lorcan. i wont be happy, and he HAS to have the right hair length, because that hair defines him :P<br /><br />From Wonkey Will<br />I think that a film would definatly be a good idea as my family won't beleve me that this is a good book. A film would get people going and would be exiting altogether.<br /><br />From Jarod Swank<br />A ''Vampirates'' movie!!!!!! That would be the best thing yet!!  Oh and by the way you are seriously the best author ever!!   I also like J.K. Rowling and Nancy Farmer but you are better than the both of them!!!   So if you can please PLEASE make a movie and a TV series! Please e-mail me back if you have the time thanks!!!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-6.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I agree there are some books gone bad from movies like eragon for example. But if you do what J.K. Rowling did (and I'm not saying the movies are fantastic they are still good) and you make so that way they take out what you allow them to or add in what they want with your permission then the movie may be one of the best movies made. Eragon they took out to much and made it into a five minute book if all you had to do was read it instead of watching it. Harry potter they took out stuff switched around some of the stuff in the story but they were still good movies and no matter what books are always better than the movies!!!<br /><br />Sheeshan the Strength of the Waves<br />Vampirates cant be a cartoon animated sereis it need more than that it has to be a film! its gonna be a hit lyk harry potter and pirates of the carribean!!<br /><br />From Sailor Vanderdecken<br />Will vampirates be ever put into a movie.  I AM GETTING IMPATIENT WITH EXCITEMENT<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="dragon" src="files/dragon.jpg" width="40" height="40" />From Sailor Black Dragon<br />I really tink Vampirates should be made into a movie.  After all, it will make people want to read the books more!!!!  ...<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="twins" src="files/twins.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Graces Evil Twin<br />Yeah I'd love to play Grace too!! It would be like the best thing ever!! Thing is because there's so may of us that want that part it kinda makes you feel like your chances of getting it are less and less. That's if they make it into a movie and if they hold open casting auditions in the UK....and other places too obviously<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="twins" src="files/twins-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Graces Evil Twin<br />I really think that Vampirates should be turned into a film with real actors in it. An animated series would just totally ruin it. Animated series are mostly for kids and all the older readers of Vampirates would not want to watch an animated series to see their favourite book brought to life. Take me for instance I am 13 years old and I have loved Vampirates since the first time I read it when I was 11. I would NOT watch a cartoon of Vampirates, it would totally kill it for me. But I do get what some of you are saying about films not always living up to the book. But take a look at Harry Potter. Before the books were turned into movies many of the fans would have said that making it a movie would ruin it and now look at how popular it is. Its one of the biggest selling blockbusters of our time. But you don't need me to tell you that. If it does get made into a film then it would be soooo much better if fans played the characters because fans know practically everything about their favourite characters don't they?<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampire" src="files/vampire.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sarah The Vampire<br />Hey!!! please make Vampirates into a movie!!! And if you do PLEASE post the news on hear for us and where the auditions are. I just love these books and I would love to see it in real action. So PLEASE make it into a REAL PEOPLE movie! Thank you.<br />P.S.  - And if you do, LOOK OUT people who are trying out for Grace! I'll be there even though I live in ND!!! Thank You . . .<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-7.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I love the Vampirates book and if it was made into a film i would seriously consider going for the part of Grace, but i think if it is made into a tv series it would completely ruin the book! i think a film also ruins people's imagination on the book it is such a brilliant book and i can't wait for the next book to come out in January! i think Vampirates should stay as a book because it would completely ruin people's imagination and the picture they make in their head when they read the book! After all for me the Picture i get in my head when i read a book is much stronger and better to me than the film!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-8.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I personally don't think Vampirates should be made into a TV series it would ruin it completely!! if anything it should be made into a film and not animated a bit like Pirates of the Caribbean, but still if anything just leave it as a book otherwise the who image people make up in their head when they read the book would just be ruined also the book is more of your own imagination and that's better than any film!!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="gladiator" src="files/gladiator.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From TerrorLies Mourning<br />aaaack it should so be a movie!!!! Oh Lorcan my vampire lover!!! if I can't have you I want Johnny just because vampires are the most epic thing in existence and vampirates just....o m b this would be the franking best movie ever!!! o my franking fro I'm hyperventilating! ALL'S FAIR IN BLOOD AND GORE!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="bottles" src="files/bottles.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Fenix Sky "Healer"<br />This book if turned film would be bigger the lord of rings or Pirates of the Carb.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirekiss" src="files/vampirekiss.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>From Magie The Vampirate<br />So you want to be ma kettle?!!i belive its a good idea for fans to play in the movie even as ordinary pirates or vampirates.  When the fans play in the book's movie they know just the what are the character's feelings because they are living it themselves, they read the book they know everything and they desire the life of the characters! i always liked acting but unfortunately i cant play in vampirates because there is never going to be audition in Cyprus so i prefer to help from distance you know: my ideas about the books and how should the movie be etc...<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-9.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />i reckon that Vampirates would make an epic film , it's got such an adventurous, different and exiting plot and if done properly could be really successful and not just  kids film. i think it would have to be done with real people and care should be taken with casting like having an open casting calls so as to find the right actors. I don't think a film would ruin the books , for me any way i imagine characters from books in my own way no matter if i've seen the film, but in some cases like with a character I haven't completely understood they help me to understand them and the plot more! and book-film adaptations are done so well these days (lord of the rings, narnia, inkheart, harry potter) that you have to be prety critical to complain, and anyway if your imagination is strong enough a film shouldn't ruin a book for you just give you an idea as to how another sees it.so i think a vampirates film would give great credit to how successful the books have been and would be epic!!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirekiss" src="files/vampirekiss-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>From Magie The Vampirate<br />About film or tv series and animated films i believe that the worse thing to do is to make it a series how will anybody get bound(touched)by series?its better for vampirates to become a film so that you cant wait to see the next movie, so that you miss it, and when finally the next movie arrives after a while you will be more than happy to see it!I hope this words of mine will make you think clearer!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="wait" src="files/wait-10.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor no name yet Lagger<br />I think vampirates should become a film, it is recommended to Harry Potter fans who all love the films, so why not enjoy this amazing book on the big screen??<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="coins" src="files/coins.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Purser's First Mate Honnor Kedger<br />I say no! Eragon was trash! They changed hair colours they changed plot line! If you do want to make it a movie, I say YOU have to get a say in the casting, and the script. I know they most likely wont let you but that is the only way I would say yes.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Misstress of the dark" src="files/misstressofthedark.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Felavria Vampire<br />On the film and tv page, someone said they should turn the books into films, because the golden compass and lord of the rings was a success. I have read both of those books, seen both of the films, which aren't AWFUL, but don't really do the books justice.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Misstress of the dark" src="files/misstressofthedark-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Felavria Vampire<br />Please don't make the utterly fantastic vampirates series into some awful movie, as I have seen some of my favourite books totally ruined by the film. The books are perfect as they are, as books. They are best enjoyed read in book form, or every lazy person who can't be bothered to read it will go see the film and act like an expert. Iam a huge fan so PLEASE don't destroy my favourite series books by making a film. Also the precise illustration in the covers of the books show exactly how the characters should look, and i don't think you will ever find a perfect lookalike.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="duck foot" src="files/ducksfoot.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Boatswain Duck's Foot Darcy<br />I was thinking what Vampirates would be like as a movie last night and I thought it would be great to have Tarja Turunen to sing the Vampirates sea-shanty. She's the ex-singer of Nightwish and has a rock opera voice which sounds stunning. The sea-shanty could be the backing music t the opening credits if it became a movie.<br />see <a href="http://www.tarjaturunen.com/" rel="self" title="Tarja Turunen">www.tarjaturunen.com</a><br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="ducks foot" src="files/ducksfoot-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Boatswain Duck's Foot Darcy<br />I think films sometimes do ruin books. I always think a book is better than the movie adaptation, but sometimes if films aren't as good, it puts people who aren't already fans of the books, off of even attempting to read them. The amount of my friends at school who refuse to read Harry Potter because they think the movies aren't very good, so the books will be bad too, is ridiculous! I think Vampirates would be an awesome movie if it was done properly, but it's too risky. If the casting isn't done properly and the suspense and storyline isn't as good as it is in the book, then it could go really downhill. I think it's probably best to leave the book in reader's imaginations, or get all fans on board making suggestions for cast, how the movie should be done, etc. Then the movie people will know if the film's gonna appeal to kids/teens/adults or not.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirekiss" src="files/vampirekiss-3.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>From Magie The Vampirate<br />it would be awsome to have vampirates as a movie but with not animated caracters it would be the best movie if it is made with real actors<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirekiss" src="files/vampirekiss-4.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>From Magie The Vampirate<br /> I think it would be nice to see vampirates as a movie but if vampirates really becomes a movie I believe that nothing should be cut.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="baguette" src="files/baguette.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Bandy Baguette<br />I think that it would be better to make a film based on the books, TV series are often badly done.  I like watching films of books I've read, I like seeing the ways other people interpret the character. Sometimes this gives them a new depth.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="bud" src="files/bud.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>From Sailor Anna Valerious<br />if Justin made vampirates into a tv show or movie i really hope that its NOT animated. It would be soooo cool if it was a movie with real people lol... but we all want that! If animated is the only way to put on tv though, then justin should so go for it! =)WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampire" src="files/vampire-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sarah The Vampire<br />Ever since I read the first book I've wanted to E-mail Justin Somper and ask him if he will want to make it into a movie. (in my opinion) I THINK THEY SHOULD!!!!!!! it is the best books that I have read ever and ever will.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="ring" src="files/ring-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Graces-Double<br />I really want vampirates to be a movie, if you look at things like the lord of the rings and the golden compass...  There the best films ever! I'm sure if vampirates looked like that it would be even more popular!<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="black bart" src="files/blackbart-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Notorious Black Bart's Daughter<br />I'd would love a block buster film of vampirates but not too much special effects and computer graphics, i think the ruin the film abit. I have some ideas who could play the characters like, for Molucco Wrathe, Robert Di Niro because he has a mole and same face as him, Robert Lindsey because I've seen him with long hair and round glasses on the tv and it immediately reminded me of the captain, or maybe even Tim Allen. I'm still trying to find out who to play Sidorio, but I'll let you know when i've got an idea!!!<br />SM - look under the lookalikes page for ideas.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mouse" src="files/mouse.jpg" width="41" height="41" /></div>From Ship's Mouse<br />Being Dyslexic means for a large amount of my life, I found reading books very hard work and not very enjoyable.  So for people who find reading hard, a movie introduces the book to them.  Since discovering books I can read and enjoy, I do get upset, after enjoying a book, when movies do not keep to the story line.  The sad thing is, you tend to remember the movie story line rather than the book's.  This is why I said earlier that a TV series in conjunction with the books sounds fantastic, it introduces the world of Vampirates but does not ruin the books story.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="jolly roger" src="files/jollyroger.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>From Sailor Black Anne Read<br />An animated series! You're right that is better than a movie! <br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mouse" src="files/mouse-2.jpg" width="41" height="41" /></div>From Ship's Mouse<br />At the Windsor Festival Justin Somper hinted that he had been approached about turning the Vampirates idea into an animated TV series.  Which in my mind is better than a film, (as recently my favourite books have been turned into films and the story line has been spoilt).  How I understand it the series will be along the lines of the books but not cover the content of the books.  At a guess series one would be while Connor was on the Diablo and Grace was on the Vampirate Ship.<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="jolly roger" src="files/jollyroger-2.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>From Sailor Black Anne Read<br />Are they going to make the Vampirates series into movies? They should !!<br /><a name="bluepeter"></a><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="bud" src="files/bud-2.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>From Sailor Anna Valerious from the Blue Peter Blog<br />"Sign me up for Grace and Cheng Li auditions too! lol."<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="ring" src="files/ring-3.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>From Sailor Graces-Double from the Blue Peter Blog<br />"Pleeeeeeeeeeeeesse make Vampirates into a film! id love to play grace! and also have auditions in Scotland!"<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="bud" src="files/bud-3.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>From Sailor Anna Valerious  from the Blue Peter Blog<br />"About your question, for me when I see a movie I really like such as, The Series of Unfortunate Events, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Interview with the Vampire (which I just watched AGAIN today) I go out to the store and buy the books! It makes me interested to know the whole story and the continuation. (remember when I said I read all the Series of Unfortunate Events books. I probably would have never started to even read them and finish them if it wasn't for the movie.) It gives the public a good idea of what your books are like and if they like the story line. If they are craving for more information they are likely to read the novel, even if you come out with a new continuation movie. I think that if you made Vampirates into a movie with open auditions it gives great opportunity to the lovers of the books. Vampirates, I think, would defiantly capture the attention of many people. (But you'll have to beat Pirates of the Caribbean! just kidding!)  It's different for every movie I see, for example, I like the movie Chronicles of Narnia better then the book, I liked the book better then the movie for Series of Unfortunate Events, for Interview with the Vampire(I do hope to finish one day), and Harry Potter, the books were so long I started them but never finished. I like your books because they're the right length and I'm so interested with them that I read the whole thing even if it's very long, but for example, people may think that books such as Harry Potter are too long, and the movie is just faster to watch. But please, if you have the opportunity to make this fantastic novel into a feature film DO IT. I'm sure you won't regret it. You'll be able to share the story with movie goers and book lovers."<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="black bart" src="files/blackbart-3.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Question from Notorious Black Bart's Daughter on the Blue Peter Blog<br />"Also I knew you wanted to be an actor as I do when you were younger. Did you get any parts?"<br />Answer "As you say, I did briefly entertain thoughts of being an actor when I was younger. I kept hoping I'd get discovered and would end up in some big new movie version of 'Oliver!' or some such. Did it happen? No, I am STILL waiting to be "discovered"! (Maybe if 'Vampirates' becomes a movie, I'll get a walk-on part!)"<br /><br /><div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/thenocturn/index.htm" rel="external" title="The Nocturn"><img class="imageStyle" alt="ship" src="files/ship.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>Comment and question from The Nocturn on the Blue Peter Blog<br />"I like the idea of seeing an amazing book being turned into a film. Sometimes after reading a brill book, you can imagine them making good movies. I think Vampirates would make awesome movies. But I do try not to get to hyped up because as the movie adaptation of Eragon by Christopher Paolini proved a massive disappointment I don't want to see a brilliant book be butchered. I like when they are true to the books. Rather like the Harry Potter films although some things are added and changed, they are roughly accurate.<br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Blue Peter" src="files/bluepeter-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Which of the three Vampirates books you have written do you feel, personally, would make the best movie? Out of the two we can read, I think Tide of Terror as it comes on leaps and bounds from Demons of the Ocean."<br />Answer "Which of my books would make the best movie? I think that because of the continuing story arc, a movie team would probably want to take the first three or four books together rather than just adapting one book. I think that would deliver a more satisfying story. That said, I think it would be really interesting to develop a fresh story for a movie, which brought new and existing fans into the lives of the characters from a different angle."
