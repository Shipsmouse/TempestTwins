			<h1><h5>Here Is My Copy Of The Blue Peter Blog.</h5></h1><br /><br /><div class="image-right"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/bluepeter/" rel="self" title="Blue Peter"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Blue Peter" src="files/bluepeter.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>Please note I have put it through the spell checker and tried to tidy it up a bit for my own use only.<br /><br />Hello!<br />My name's Justin Somper and I'm really excited to be Blue Peter's very first 'Star Author'. That's quite some title to live up to so wish me luck! I'm the author of the VAMPIRATES books. Perhaps you have read DEMONS OF THE OCEAN or TIDE OF TERROR? (Don't worry if you haven't - I shan't be quizzing you!). Over the next three months, I'll be writing a blog just for you guys, which I hope will tell/show you what it's like to be a real-life author. Some of it is probably just as you'd expect but I hope there will be plenty of surprises too. It should be an interesting few months for me as I'm due to hand in the manuscript of the third VAMPIRATES novel, BLOOD CAPTAIN, towards the end of May. I have a LOT of writing to do to make that deadline and I'll be keeping you posted here on how I'm getting on with it.<br /><br />As well as telling you what I'm getting up to, I'm here to answer YOUR questions about writing. I'd love to hear from any of you writers or would-be (hey, what's stopping you?!) writers out there. Maybe you're working on a story yourself and want some advice on planning the plot or creating characters. I don't have any 'magic' formula but, chances are, I've wrestled with some of the same challenges as you - and still am! So please don't be shy about getting in touch.<br /><br />This is a great week, I think, to be starting the blog. For one thing, Thursday, 1st of March is World Book Day, which is all about celebrating the fun of reading so I reckon a great way to mark the day is to tell your best mate about a book you've read and enjoyed. Better still, lend them your copy!<br />How am I going to be spending World Book Day? Well, for a start, I'm one of the ten lucky authors who were asked to write a one pound book especially for the day. I've written a mini VAMPIRATES adventure called DEAD DEEP, the action of which occurs between that of the first two books. I say 'mini' because the one pound book comes in at 10, 000 words, whereas my last book was around the 94, 000 word mark. You'd think that writing a 10, 000 word book would be easier and quicker than writing a 94, 000 word one, wouldn't you? I did but I was wrong! It was a good learning curve for me as I realised that I like time to build up my characters and story. I even had to start writing shorter chapters!<br /><br />On World Book Day itself, I'll be joining the likes of Anthony Horowitz, Malorie Blackman and Jacqueline Wilson for a special event at London's Globe Theatre. We'll have an audience of about 300 London school kids. I always enjoy doing events with readers, but I get a little nervous beforehand. Getting up and talking about books is kind of a performance - but I'm more nervous than usual about this World Book Day event. For one thing, it's hosted by Lizo from NEWSROUND, so there may be a camera or two there. And also, I'll be 'performing' alongside some of the biggest names in the writing business.<br /><br />I guess I'd better go and practice... See you next week and don't forget to send in some questions for me!!!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys! Thanks for all your posts on the blog, your kind comments about my 'Vampirates' books and your GREAT questions. I want to give these the attention they deserve, so please bear with me. I'll answer as many as possible this week and over the next eleven weeks that I'm blogging here.<br /><br />It's been a really hectic week due to World Book Day. The event at the UnderGlobe on World Book Day itself went really well. Although eight authors were involved, we managed not to run TOO far over time. It was fun meeting the 300 kids who came along, plus the other authors. Below is a pic of me backstage with Anthony Horowitz and Caroline "The Roman Mysteries" Lawrence. How did you lot spend World Book Day? Let me know. Now, onto YOUR questions ...<br /><br />What do you do to prepare before writing a book?<br />Gingerjames, you ask how I prepare before writing a book. It changes all the time but with 'Blood Captain', the book I'm currently working on, I spent a while plotting out the book into "three acts" and then into individual chapters. This was quite hard but it is proving really helpful - it might be something for you to try with your own writing, especially if you are attempting a longer story for the first time. One of the most useful aspects of plotting in this way is that it prompts you to ask yourself lots of questions about the story.<br /><br />The other thing I do at the start is research any new characters and locations. For 'Blood Captain', I had fun researching cowboys to create my new cowboy Vampirate, Johnny Desperado. I also have a big new location in the book, called Sanctuary. It's a mountaintop retreat for tormented vampires and I wanted it to have a very particular feel and to persuade readers it might actually exist. In my new office I have a wall where I put up pictures to inspire me about how characters and locations might look.<br /><br />I heard you are friends with Anthony Horowitz. Do you have any other writer friends. Also, how do you go about publishing a book. Thank you.<br />Lucia, you want to know how you go about publishing a book. Obviously the first thing you need is an idea. Then you have two options. Either you go off and write the whole book OR you write a chunk of it plus a synopsis of how the story will continue. For 'Vampirates', I initially wrote eight chapters plus a synopsis and some other background notes. The next step is almost certainly to get an agent. Their first role is generally to pitch your idea to one or more publishers. Publishers don't always have time to look at stuff sent direct to them by writers but they will look at what an agent shows them. That doesn't mean they're going to take it, though! 'Vampirates' was turned down by a fair few publishers before it found the right home. You just have to remain hopeful and try not to bite off all your nails at this point. How about I cover the next parts of the publishing process in future blogs?<br /><br />And now some quick-fire answers ...<br /><br />How long did it take you to make Vampirates 1st and 2nd episode?<br />Bookster, it took about five years to write 'Demons of the Ocean' (including research) and about one year to write 'Tide of Terror'.<br /><br />I write really good stories at school, but at home I am hopeless. Have You got any tips I could use, and a title to write a story about?<br />Writing machine, if you can write stories at school you must be able to do them at home too! My tip is to sit down and write uninterrupted for an hour and see how much you get done. A title for your story? "The Worst Week of My Life".<br /><br />For awhile I've been wanting to say how much I enjoyed your books, they were quite an up-lifter to me, because movies and such about vampires have gotten so bad, I was glad to see a children's book without anything bad, especially without things that could fly over younger ones heads. Tis only sad that it was such a quick read.<br />I was wondering if Blood Captain is going to be the last book? I read on a website(That I cannot find now.) that is was going to be the last, which really made my heart sink.<br />Will you be updating your website anymore? Would you ever be posting pictures of your characters, other than what is on the website? I'm sorry for many questions, I suppose I could say I'm like Grace, because of that and much more. Its just exciting to see this blog.<br />I really do hope to see you updating this, and hopefully more books after Blood Captain.<br />Reeper, 'Blood Captain' is NOT going to be the last 'Vampirates' book ...<br /><br />Justin I have read your first Vampirate book, it was my favourite book and a fantastic idea. I have made myself a Vampirate I have started your second book but I really want to know when your third book is coming out and are there anymore planned after that!<br />Gingergeorge, 'Blood Captain' will be published in September ... so I had better get back to working on it!<br /><br />Have any of you been inspired to get writing? If so, let me know how you're getting on and what tips you'd like to help you along the way. Catch you next week!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys! I hope you've had a good week. It's been an exciting and busy one for me. Exciting because my World Book Day book, Vampirates: Dead Deep, made number seven in the best seller lists (my highest ever ranking!) and busy because I was out and about visiting schools this week. Hello to all those of you I met and thanks to all the rest of you who have sent in comments and questions to the blog. Keep them coming!<br /><br />I thought this week I'd give you some ideas on how to develop characters, as this is a question that has come up both on the blog and when I've been out and about. It's part of the writing process I really enjoy. Sometimes it comes easily, sometimes it takes a bit more work.<br /><br />In my new book, I'm introducing the character of cowboy vampire, Johnny Desperado. I had the idea for him a good couple of years ago and he almost appeared in Tide of Terror, but I decided that his time hadn't quite come. When I sat down to plot out Blood Captain, I had a much better idea of how he would work within the story. Then I just had to find his "voice" and his "back story". This took a bit of work. I knew that Johnny was more of an authentic cowboy (i.e. someone who worked with cattle) rather than a shoot-em-up "Cowboys vs Indians" type. But where might he have come from? How would he talk? What would he look like? How would he die?! (I always like to have a good "crossing story" for my characters.)<br /><br />To get to grips with these questions, I got hold of a couple of books about real-life cowboys. I also bought a few DVDs of Westerns. I had originally intended for Johnny to be blue-eyed and blonde - a really iconic American figure. But as I read in the book about Mexican cowboys or "Vacqueros", this seemed a more interesting way to go. I found out that Vacqueros were very talented horsemen and often taught the other cowboys how to "break" wild horses in. I'm always interested in outsider figures in Vampirates and the Mexican cowboy seemed to offer more potential here too. I could also see him charming my lead character Grace, so I decided to go with it. I'm not going to give away the whole of Johnny's story here, but suffice to say it involves a journey from Texas to the South Dakota Badlands, where he meets a nasty end.<br /><br />All of this came together through reading around the subject and "cutting" and "pasting" a story together. I did watch a couple of Westerns, which gave me a nice feel for some of the landscape he might travel through and a sense of the loneliness of his life. When you're working on characters, there's nothing better than getting inside their heads and getting inside their world.<br />And now the quick-fire stuff...<br /><br />Thanks for the great tips!! By the way I have been reading your special world book day book dead deep.  I love it and I am so addicted<br />How long did it take you to write it?<br />Gingejames, Glad you enjoyed Dead Deep. It took about four months to write, even though it's quite a short book!<br /><br />Hey Justin, its Ryan here, Well, I have seen the cover on your inspiration wall for BLOOD CAPTAIN. It looks absolutely brill and I cannot wait to read the book.<br />HalfbloodRyan, leave it to you to spot the book jacket! It's pretty cool, isn't it?<br /><br />Its enjoyable being able to read these blogs, its not an often thing to find. Not a first starting one anyway.<br />Over in the US, your books tend to come late. Such as Tides of Terror, its not coming out here until this summer. Writing is personal for me, so I would like to know insight to others. Well, thanks.<br />Reeper, nice to hear from a reader in the US. Yes, Tide of Terror is out there in June.<br /><br />I love writing and drawing but whenever I have to write a story I cant think what to do it on.  Could ya please give me some tips<br />Amber4rooney, hope this week's blog gets you thinking about creating characters.<br /><br />Have you ever meet J.K. Rowling (Harry potter writer)<br />Lauryn, I haven't met J K Rowling yet but, of course, I'd love to. I was once alone in a hotel lounge and she came in but I went a bit shy!<br /><br />OK, I'm off to do some more writing now. Keep the questions coming and have fun with your own writing - and reading - this week!<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys! I hope you've all been busy reading and writing. Truth to tell, I haven't got much writing done this week as I was struck down by flu. I have, however, been doing LOTS of reading. These days, being in bed with flu, is one of the few chances I get to just lie back and read. Thanks for your comments and questions on the blog. Do keep them coming!<br /><br />One of the questions we writers get asked ALL the time is "where do you get your ideas from?" It's a tough one to answer and I can't do much better than quote the inventor Thomas Edison who said, "genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration." Ideas are magical, unpredictable things. Take Vampirates. A lot of people think that I was rather cunning and strategic in putting the worlds of vampires and pirates together. Not a bit of it! The word "Vampirates" simply popped into my head one day. I knew that something very special had happened. Not only did the word SOUND exciting but the idea of meshing together the worlds of vampires and pirates seemed full of promise.<br /><br />Who knows exactly where this idea came from - I just feel very lucky that it dropped into MY head. That said, the initial excitement gave way to some uncertainty, anxiety and sense of responsibility. In other words, the inspiration was swiftly followed by perspiration!<br /><br />I felt that as the idea had come my way, I really had to do it justice. I was very aware that I knew next to nothing about vampires and, frankly, even less about pirates. I knew that if I was going to make something of the idea, I'd have to start doing my research. Now, obviously, I couldn't research vampire pirates BUT I could look into the worlds of pirate history and vampire myth and help the idea to grow (a bit like feeding a plant, I guess!) As soon as I started finding out about pirates and vampires, I began to see different ways in which I could take the idea. I had a sense of some of the characters I might like to include and possible settings for the story.<br /><br />This was also a time to ask myself lots of questions about the story, such as would it be set in the present, past or future? Another important question was who would be the good guys and who would be the bad guys? (Traditionally, both pirates and vampires tend to be "the baddies" even if they are "anti-heroes" but two sets of baddies isn't helpful in a story!)<br /><br />Once you start developing an idea, its internal logic that helps you to flesh it out further. Here's an example. Because I decided to set my story in the future - and because I have vampire characters who are the "living dead" - I could bring together characters from many different eras and locations. For instance, my character Sidorio is based on a real-life Roman pirate. He sits neatly in my story because although he was killed in Roman times, he has been a vampire ever since.<br /><br />It's no exaggeration to say that the single moment of inspiration which brought me the idea for Vampirates has changed my life. So do watch out - you never know when inspiration might strike. Be ready to catch that idea and run with it!<br /><br />My mate Edd suggested to me that you could put other groups of characters together to make exciting new stories - for instance, you could take Zombies and Cowboys and write about "Zomboys". I think there's definite potential there! Can you guys think of any fun combinations of characters that would work well together? Remember, the word itself has to work well too. Let me know any of your top ideas!<br /><br />And now the quick-fire stuff...<br /><br />Thanks this will really help me while I write my stories and make my characters that much better!!<br />Spoony, glad you liked my tips on creating characters. I hope you'll have a go at developing your own characters and report back on your success.<br /><br />Actually, a lot of Americans are light brown-haired. The blondes are typically died this way. Brown eyes seem common too...but America is also made up of a lot of culture, so its all here. I suppose iconic means, in this case, what people would see as American.<br />I saw that a few of your characters were based on real life figures, or figures in real life events. So are all of your characters based on real life figures, or are some made up, like maybe Grace and Connor, from a bit more of imagination.(Not that the others didn't take imagination, rather, you had to make up there background too)<br />Also, what gave you idea for these characters?<br />Reeper, thanks for posting again and point taken about blonde Americans! No, not all of my characters are based on real-life characters. In almost all cases, the initial idea for a character just comes in my head, but I might then do some research to flesh them out and make them distinct from other characters.<br /><br />I have read your book and it is great I got 3 WBD books because my 2 friends didn't want their tokens. They have been really silly because they keep asking me for a lend of my books I know what you did last Wednesday, The horrible science book and of course Vampirates.<br />Leanne, I hope you're enjoying all those World Book Day books you scooped up. Sounds like you could start your own mini-library. Go girl!<br /><br />What are you busy writing at the moment? if anything. I am a big fan of your book and look forward to any more! :-)<br />Funky kid, I'm busy writing Vampirates 3: Blood Captain. As mentioned earlier, I didn't get much done this week due to illness, so I'd better start making up for lost time! See ya ;-)<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys!<br />Thanks for your comments and "get well" messages. I'm pleased to say that I'm fighting fit and back at the helm of Blood Captain. As my mum said to me yesterday, "you're always happier when you're writing". You know what? She's not wrong!<br />Reeper - you asked so many great questions last week that I've written this week's blog as an interview with you...<br /><br />Reeper: How do you organise your story?<br />Justin: I touched on this in an earlier blog. I never used to do much planning but writing a big story like Vampirates, it's really helpful to do so. For the first book, Demons of the Ocean, I got some big flip chart paper and made a grid of all the chapters. Initially, I did this with post-it notes so I could swap around chapters. For Blood Captain, the book I'm working on now, the grid is on the computer and I refer to it and alter it all the time.<br /><br />But what would I advise you to do? It really depends how long the stories you're working on are and if you're wanting to write a continuing story - like a book sequence or TV series. There's definitely no harm in a bit of planning - it should make your story tighter and more give it more pace. Have a think about the "journey" you want your key character/s to make during the story. There might be other stuff you "know" about the characters that doesn't need to come out in this story or episode. Just keep it in reserve for later! You might like to break the story into "three acts" and have two cliffhangers along the way or just split it in two and have something big happen halfway through. Remember that you probably want the most tension right before the end of the story. But don't get too hung up on all this. Really, the more you write - and read - the more you'll find ways to organise your thoughts and characters.<br /><br />Reeper: Were you ever afraid someone would come up with the idea of Vampirates and publish a book about them before you?<br />Justin: Yes I was. My first thought when I had the idea for Vampirates was "great idea! Get writing!" My second was, "I don't know enough about pirates or vampires to write this! Better do some research!" And my third was, "What if someone else has this idea too?" All I could do was get on with my writing and see what I personally made of the idea. I'm pleased to say that now, though people are initially excited by the concept of vampires meets pirates, a lot of people seem to be invested in the characters and storylines I've come up with beyond the initial idea.<br /><br />Reeper: Have you ever felt like giving up on your books?<br />Justin: Nope! Even when lots of publishers were saying "no thanks" to Vampirates, I thought that the idea would eventually win out. And it did, thanks to readers like you!<br /><br />Reeper: Do you have friends and family supporting you in writing? Have they always?<br />Justin: Absolutely! My friends and family are a huge support and often have to endure readings of new chapters, bounce ideas around or pep up my spirits when I say "I'm not sure I can do it!" My friend Debbie has been especially helpful and even gave me the idea for a figurehead who comes to life - so I dedicate the character of Darcy Flotsam to her!<br /><br />Reeper: How do you choose the illustrator for your book covers?<br />Justin: My publisher chose Bob Lea but I think he's great so I'm very happy with their choice.<br /><br />Thanks for the interview, Reeper!<br /><br />If you have any questions you'd like me to answer, post them on the blog. Looking forward to reading more of your comments and questions next week!<br />Have fun reading and writing this week, guys.<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />I cannot tell you how honoured I feel that you would do that! What's so amazing is that I have to do an interview with someone for school, and I didn't even know I was doing one yet!<br />*Gets hold of self* Alright, now...You say that when you thought of Vampirates, it was spur of the moment thing. You also don't have any other books on the market, so were you much of a writer before Vampirates?<br />I've read in a few interviews on the net that you have a job while writing Vampirates, and are working with two publishers. What exactly do you do in these jobs? I ask because we don't usually know how writers make money while writing.<br />When you first started off with the book, did you intend for it to be a Children's Book? Will Blood Captain be aimed for Children or Young Adults?<br />Locations- In Demons of the Ocean, the island that Grace and Connor live on is in Australia, am I right? Was there a reason you chose this location?<br />Do you have plans for any other books, other than Vampirates.<br />And, do you ever get Fan Art? (This one is pure wonder)<br />Its nice to hear you're doing better, and its probably a good thing writing is like that for you. After all, anything worth doing isn't easy.<br />Have a nice week, and good luck with your writing!<br />~Reeper<br /><br />----<br /><br />Hi guys! Well you lot were a bit quiet last week, I must say! What happened? Were you all too busy making Dalek cakes to celebrate The Doctor's return? Were you planning your entries for the Blue Peter "My Movie" comp? Or were you, perhaps, suffering from a chronic, communal case of Writer's Block?!<br /><br />I'm often asked whether I get writer's block and, if so, how I deal with it.<br /><br />The answer is... it depends what you call writer's block! Some people say it's that feeling of staring at a blank computer screen - or piece of paper - and not knowing how to begin. My experience is a bit different to that...<br /><br />There are days when you sit down at the computer and the words just seem to flow. The dialogue comes out right. The length of your chapters is what you were hoping for and you successfully get your story from the "A" to "B" you were hoping to. And then... there are other days when it's like writing underwater. The words may still come but they don't feel quite right. The dialogue veers into clich&eacute;. The chapters are massively too long and the story seems to have taken a strange turn. This is how I tend to experience writer's block. To coin a phrase, I'm just not "in the zone".<br /><br />I reckon it comes down to the same thing. On some days, you find it easy to get (back) into the world of your story and, on other days, it feels like whatever you do, you're shut out. Susan Cooper (author of the fabulous 'The Dark Is Rising') once compared writing to "a closed room with a door without a handle. Just occasionally that door opens and you can get in." I think she may be being a bit harsh, but there are some days when I think of that closed door, grin inanely and nod my head.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was chatting to another author, K M Peyton (author of the classic 'Flambards'), recently and we agreed that if we only wrote on days when we "felt like it", we'd get very little writing done at all. And she should know what she's talking about... she's written a book a year for the past sixty (yes, sixty!) years. Respect!<br /><br />So if we accept that some writing days are tougher than others, what tips can I pass on to help you through the toughies?<br /><br />1. The first thing is... don't get upset or take it too seriously. You'll get back in there and faster than you think. Stressing about it is only likely to make you tired and cross and the problem worse.<br /><br />2. Write anyway - Sometimes the best thing you can do is just allocate the same time to writing and see what you come up with. You might say to yourself, "today's a tough day so I'm not likely to come up with anything amazing". And just by giving yourself a break, you might surprise yourself! Whether you spend the time looking at the pad or computer, uninspired, or you write loads of "drivel", you'll probably find that just by sticking with it, you come up with an idea you can use in your next writing session - a way back in.<br /><br />3. Go and do something else - Writing stories is a strange process and sometimes you need to switch off your conscious mind in order to let the subconscious get to work. You could go and see a movie, or do a bit of shopping or meet with some friends.<br /><br />4. Talk through the block - You could just sit down with a good mate and tell them where you've got to in the story and why you're stuck. I find that when I do this, I often talk myself to the answer I'm looking for without them really saying anything. Warning: you need a patient mate for this!<br /><br />5. Clear other distractions - It's all too easy to get distracted from your story when your head starts <br />filling up with other stuff. This could range from another bit of work you have to do or working out what to get your best mate for their birthday. In this case, it's generally worth giving your full attention to one of the pressing things and getting it out of your head. Then your story can expand into those free brain cells again! Warning: for this technique to work, at some point, you have to let your writing be the top priority!<br /><br />6. Do more research - Sometimes you hit a bit of a wall in a story when you introduce a new character or a new location. In this case, a bit of fresh research is often the key. And remember, "research" need not mean spending hours in the library or on the internet. It could simply be asking yourself questions about the character or writing a small piece of prose from his or her point of view to help you get to know them better.<br /><br />7. Go and do something physical - It's funny but this seems to work every time - from walking to running, swimming to gymming. By giving the body a workout, you somehow shake up your brain and you might even get ideas coming to you as you pound the streets.<br /><br />These are just some of the techniques that work for me. Next time YOU are struggling with a story, see if one or more of them work for you. And let me know.<br /><br />Now I hope some of you are going to send in some fresh comments and queries this week. Otherwise, I might get writer's block about what to put into next week's blog ;-)<br />Justin<br /><br />----<br /><br />Hi guys! I hope you all had a great Easter and that you're enjoying the break from school. I had a brilliant Easter weekend. I got loads of writing done, which made me very happy! It wasn't too much of a hardship jumping out of bed and putting in a couple of hours' writing time on those sunny mornings. The only day I had completely off was Easter Sunday when I spent a very warm and sunny day by the river in Henley. Of course, while I was at the river, I couldn't resist checking out some of the boats, so I didn't completely leave the story behind! There was even one ship flying the pirate flag. Good to know that even in civilised Henley, the spirit of piracy is alive and well. Now onto your very excellent questions...<br /><br />I just wanted to say again, that I really really loved the first 2 Vampirates Books. I actually finished them in the space of 3 days!!!<br />I was wondering though, how did you come up with the character of Lorcan Furey? What inspired you? He is most defiantly my favourite of the characters.<br />I can't wait for the third book to come out. Thank-you so much for making me love reading again!<br />Gupreet, nice to hear from you again. Thanks for your flattering comments. I'm not exactly sure how I came up with the character of Lorcan. He kind of just walked in to the story fully-formed. He seems very popular with readers and I'm not sure that he was sufficiently to the fore of 'Tide of Terror'. He will be back centre stage in 'Blood Captain'!<br /><br />Hi again! I sent you an email just the other day and am glad you responded and sent me this link. It was interesting to read about what you do as an author. Do you have any children that inspired you for the characters Grace and Connor? I thought that Dead Deep was the third book, but now I know it's a story in between the first and second book. As I said in my email I am writing another story called "Ghosts from the Past" I think it will be better then my last book, but I hardly ever get to work on it. I'm hoping today I will be able to. Thanks for listening!<br />P.S. You like Abercombie? That's awesome!<br />Danielle, good to hear from you again too! The character of Connor was in part inspired by one of my nephews, Matt, who was about the same age when I was working on the first book. It certainly helped me to think, "What would Matt do or say or think about this?" But, as you go on, the character really takes over and now I can ask instead, "What would Connor do... etc?" Good luck with your new story and thanks for subtly pointing out that I seem to have been wearing the same t-shirt in a lot of the blog pics! You'll be pleased to know it's in the wash today!<br /><br />i tried that stuff and I found really helpful  The physical stuff was surprising helpful, but I had to spend a long time finding a patient enough friend to help me.  when I found her she was very kind and understanding. she turned out to be having the same problem and we found each over answers to our puzzles.<br />everything worked and I would use it again<br />Emilea, I'm delighted that talking to a friend helped with your writing. Remember this next time you get stuck!<br /><br />I found myself organizing my story, which made it all better, so many different ideas for the story came to mind while doing it too.<br />Not gonna ask much this week...Just.<br />How exactly do you get a book published, and printed?<br />I was going through the many stories I started in the past, today, and realised how hard it was for me to organize everything.<br />So how do YOU organise your story? Or do you even? I find myself jumping and then typing up everything, just to end with nothing. No matter how much research I did in that day.<br />Were you ever afraid someone would come up with the idea of Vampirates, and publish a book about them, before you?<br />Have you ever felt like giving up on your books? Do you have friends and family supporting you in writing, have they always?<br />And, last but not least, how do you choose the illustrator for your book covers? Or does the Publisher do that?<br />Reeper, hello! Loads of great questions from you as ever...<br />I touched on the start of the publishing process in a previous blog (scroll down!) and I'll write about the next steps soon! 'Blood Captain' will be, like all the books in the sequence, a children's book. That said, I seem to have quite a wide age-range of readers, which is cool. The new book is a little more sophisticated and perhaps a bit more scary than the first two. The characters and the world of the story are developing all the time.<br />You're right that the action of the story kicks off in Australia. Not everyone spots that! The reason for that was partly that I thought most children's books tended be set in the UK or the US and I wanted to do something a bit different. I also wanted a good jumping off point from which the ships in the story could sail. They haven't moved very far in the first two books, but the action travels to India in 'Blood Captain'.<br /><br />First off I would like to congratulate you on writing such amazing and gripping books. Did you want to write a book before you got the idea of Vampirates or was it when you got the idea that you first attempted writing a book? I am trying to write a book but I just don't have any good ideas, I have started countless books but they just seem to go no where. Would you recommend persevering or giving it a brake and seeing if the brilliant idea I've been searching for just comes to me.<br />When I read on your blog blood captain was not going to be your last Vampirate book I was over the moon, when you write your books do more ideas come to you therefore you have to write another book or have you had it planed from the beginning how many books you were going to write and what was going to happen in them. If you haven't planned how many books your going to write then how many more do you reckon you will write, (please try to maximise this figure).<br />Rolo, thanks for saying such nice things! I attempted writing long before I got the idea for 'Vampirates'. I even had something published. But I think 'Vampirates' marked a really proper start on my career as a children's author. I have a very definite answer for you - PERSEVERE! Don't worry about getting a big "high-concept" idea. Try to write about some engaging, believable characters to start with. They could either be doing really regular stuff in a realistic setting OR you could put them in a very strange setting (e.g. outer space or the Wild West) but still try to make them act and talk in believable ways. That's something I really try hard to achieve. If you want further inspiration on this, watch the current series of 'Doctor Who' - the writers are really ace at this. Come back and let me know how you get on. Oh and there will be at least six main 'Vampirates' books because my UK publisher has contracted them!<br /><br />Keep your questions coming in, and catch you next week!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys!<br />I just got back from the London International Book Fair. This fair, which packs out Earl's Court, is a three-day event, gathering together everyone who's anyone in publishing from all over the world. Publishing companies take stands there to showcase their wares and I was especially excited to see that my UK publisher, Simon & Schuster, had decorated their stand with a massive Vampirates display. As you can see from the photo, it certainly brought a smile to my face!<br /><br />I'm dead lucky that Vampirates has over 20 publishers all over the globe, from Italy to Poland, from Russia to the USA. This very morning I signed a contract with Finland and I've also just agreed an offer from Romania (I figure they like vampires over there!). I get sent copies of the different editions of the books so I'm building up a nice library. My agents have encouraged publishers to use the same cover artwork and Vampirates logo, even if it means changing a letter here or there. Almost all of them have done this - the exceptions being the super-stylish Italians (who elected to put Lorcan Furey on their cover) and my US publisher, Little Brown, who commissioned some very different, but nonetheless stunning, artwork. I'm happy to say that both these publishers did still use the logo, so that the books have a strong link wherever you pick them up and whatever language you read them in.<br /><br />Now I'm no great linguist, with only "A" level French and a bit of holiday Italian and Spanish, but it's still great fun to flip through the books and see the stories in different languages. In the case of the Russian edition (which has extra metallic lightning on the front), I don't even recognise the letters as it uses a different alphabet. I do get e-mails from time to time from the translators who work tirelessly to get things right for their country's readers. My French translator Catherine is especially precise, and sometimes asks me questions I can't even answer!<br /><br />One of the nice things about the London International Book Fair is that you never know quite who you might bump into there. I was really thrilled to see my Spanish publisher Teresa. Demons of the Ocean has done really well in Spain - I've just been sent its 5th edition - so it was great to say hi and a very big thank you to Teresa for championing the book over there.<br /><br />A number of you have been asking about the publishing process and I hope you can start to see from this roll-call of names just how much of a team sport it is! I guess I started the ball rolling but there are a lot of other people - my agent, my publishing team, the cover artist and logo designers (different by the way), my international agents, the international publishers, translators etc. who have made a vital contribution to the books' success. Perhaps that also shows you that there are lots of fun jobs in publishing aside from being a writer yourself.<br /><br />Now, a few answers to your questions and comments...<br /><br />Hello! I've been reading all your blogs and firstly, I'd like to thank you for all your tips. They are really fantastic! I've always loved reading and writing, and I've written a lot of stories. Reading your blogs has inspired me to continue, so I'd like to thank you for that too! I've got a new idea, and established the plot and I'm currently working out the characters - names, ages, appearances, personality, likes/dislikes... Is that what you do before writing?<br />When you were beginning your career, how did you really get started and get established? Authors always say the key is to read a lot - which I have always done. But what I'd really like to know is how you really kick off your career. <br />I know you said you'll post about publishing, so I'm looking forward to reading about that!<br />Is it possible for younger people to get published? I know some do - for example, there was one author who had a book published when she was 14 - but this is very rare. Do publishers prefer books from adult authors even if the books are of the same or close standard?<br />Oh yeah, and I forgot to say - I'm not going to try to rush my story to get it out there and published a.s.a.p. I'm going to make the story perfect even if it takes me ages!<br />One thing I wonder is how you know when your story is publishing quality. Publishers only want good stories and I don't know if my writing is that kind of standard or could be that standard. Did you just know when your writing was good enough for publishing or did you just try?<br />RACHEL, hello and thanks for your lovely feedback. I'm excited to hear that you're working on something yourself. Sounds like you're doing lots of great preparation. This will help you loads when you come to the writing, I reckon. In terms of kicking off your career and getting published... well, it certainly is possible for young people to get published. There's a UK author called Catherine Webb, who was first published aged 16... and very good she is too (check out The "Extraordinary and Unusual Adventures of Horatio Lyle"). Christopher "Eragon" Paolini was 18, I think, when he first got published. Publishers like publicising young writers so they take teen writers very seriously. I would just say, to balance that, that getting published is not a race and in many ways I'm grateful that I'm in my 30s now that Vampirates is taking off. You don't want to burn out! One of the nice things about writing is that you never get too old to do it. Indeed, I think it gets better as you bring more life experience to what you write. It isn't like being a pop star or a sportswoman, where you have to look a certain way or be mega-fit. So why rush? The main thing for you now is to have fun with your writing. Hope I'm not sounding like a fuddy duddy here ;-)<br /><br />The questions that you answered to the other people who commented answered some of my questions too. Thanks for responding when I asked about the characters Grace and Connor. Since I finished the second book I have been hoping to get the Vampirates Dead Deep book as soon as I can. I am so into the series that I find it hard to really concentrate on another. I found that same problem when I was reading the Lemony Snicket books and I was delighted to hear that you actually met Lemony Snicket! I am hoping to find a way to get it shipped to me from the uk but amazon.com.uk doesn't ship down here. I am hoping to try again soon. I was just reading Reepers comment above and found questions that I would also like to know the answer to. One more thing, Have you always wanted to be an author? and have you always been interested in vampires and pirates?<br />DANIELLE, nice to hear from you again! I've always wanted to write. I'm not sure if that means I've always wanted to be an author. Perhaps! I have NOT always been interested in vampires and pirates. Indeed, as I've said before, the idea for Vampirates was a bit intimidating for me at first as I knew next to nothing about vampires and even less about pirates. These days, however, having done a fair bit of research, I am really into pirate history. It's fascinating!<br /><br />I know you had said some things in previous blogs about publishing, I guess I mean morely, What are the expenses? I've read that publishers require you to pay for the printing, and that such. I shall wait for the blog when you explain though.<br />Australia was a pretty good pick then! I don't think there's a whole lot there, which makes the small town they lived in much easier to imagine.<br />You made the story so much farther into the future, is there a reason? I haven't found much that could make it seem futuristic, other than a sports car. I want to say I recall something about a flood...but I've had to read more books since Vampirates, so I could be wrong?<br />Characters- When writing, how do you choose names and ages for your characters. That's always been a problem for me, its like, I don't want everyone the same age, and I surely don't want to use very common names. Do you have this problem?<br />Ah, also, its may seem my questions are repeated, I just don't put them as great as I could. Sorry for that.<br />Oh...six books, that's an exciting thought! Now there needs to be a store that gets them sooner over here...<br />REEPER, my man! I promise to talk more on the publishing process very very soon (probably next week) but NO, publishers don't require you to pay for printing the books. That's their job. I love choosing names for my characters and, as you'll have noticed, I like quite strange, hard-to-place names. Go wild with it! I agree that it's also good to have a wide age-range of characters. It gives an added dimension to stories when people have different ages and therefore different levels of experience to share and draw on.<br /><br />Keep those questions coming and catch you next week!<br />Veale pronto (as they say in Spain!)<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys!<br />Way back in my second blog, I talked a bit about how you get published. Since then, a number of you have been asking about how the publishing process works so I think it's high time I picked up the story!<br /><br />The author's first and main point of contact at their publisher's is their editor. Mine's called Venetia and it was her idea to make Vampirates a sequence of books rather than a one-off. This gives you an idea of just how important your editor's input can be! Venetia is a Commissioning Editor, rather than a Copy Editor. This means that she decides which books and authors to publish on her "list". The amount of contact between author and editor varies from case to case. I generally get on with writing the first draft of the book myself. Then, I hand it over to Venetia and the editing process begins. In some ways, this is a bit like being at school and getting very detailed feedback from a teacher. The difference is that you don't have to follow all your editor's suggestions! That said, I really enjoy the editorial process and having someone else closely read the book and suggest ways that it can be better. I'd say that in 9 out of 10 instances, I agree with Venetia's suggestions and make the changes. I'll give you an example of when we disagreed! In TIDE OF TERROR, she thought I should cut the character of Jez out altogether and kill off Bart instead. I had to say "no!" to this but I did give it plenty of thought.<br /><br />Venetia's suggestions generally fall into two categories. She'll look at the structure of the book overall and see how it's working. If the pace is uneven, she might suggest cutting some text or even a whole chapter or two. In Demons of the Ocean, we cut two chapters where Cheng Li sailed off to Pirate Academy, as they sat strangely in the middle of the book (especially as the action moves between Grace and Connor throughout). And in Tide of Terror, there's a chapter we cut where Connor and Bart are sent by Molucco to buy coffins. On the other hand, after reading Dead Deep, she asked me to write a fresh chapter - Chapter Three - to increase the action in Calle del Marinero and show Connor, Bart and Jez getting up to some piratical mischief.<br /><br />As well as suggesting big changes like these, Venetia will also look in a more detailed way at my writing and let me know if there are any particular pieces of description or dialogue that could be worked on. Sometimes she suggests how to do this. It might only be a matter of changing, adding or removing a word or two.<br /><br />After we've sorted everything out to our satisfaction, she'll bring in a Copy Editor. It's her job to read the manuscript in minute detail, checking for things including spellings, correct choice of words and grammar. Sometimes I repeat the same word within a few lines. I might not notice this but my fab Copy Editor - Jane - always does! Editors use a special range of symbols to "mark up" their changes on the manuscript, so it can look a bit like code at points. The other thing which Copy Editors do is check the continuity of the story and the books in the sequence - this is really helpful with a big ongoing saga like Vampirates.<br /><br />Once my two editors and I have agreed all the changes, the manuscript goes off to be typeset. This means that instead of working from the version I've typed up, it comes back still as loose pages but formatted just like you see it in the finished book. At this point, I generally have one more read through and can still make a few changes if I want to. But after that, I have the tough job of letting it go.<br /><br />It's quite hard letting go but at some point you have to - if you want to see it published anyhow ;-) I'll let you into a secret though - sometimes when I'm reading the book out loud - at a school, say - I make small alterations as I'm going along!<br /><br />Now, a few answers to your ace questions and comments...<br /><br />Well, I take no offence in the "My Man" comment, I have lots of boy relatives after all, but I am a girl. Just so you know.<br />Did you mention this blog would be up for only a little bit?...12 weeks, or something Do you plan to continue blogging, or will this be it?<br />Ok, this doesn't have so much to do with publishing, just a quicky.- There's all these contests out there where if you win, you can get your book published However if your book is published its only one.(Saying you have a series planned) Sometimes they even obtain the copy rights, and its not really yours anymore.(Like any contest.) This and more. So would you suggest actually publishing or a contest.<br />And thus comes the next question.- In previous entries, you said you didn't really know much about vampires or pirates before this book. Have they much grown on you since you've started the book? A lot of times people write with what they like, Adventure, Horror, Mystery. It doesn't really seem this way with you though. Is this true?<br />The fact that you got to go and sword fight for the book is really quit cool. Are there other things you have done or plan on doing, so you can better the book?<br />Such as languages. Did you learn them over your life, or did your book have something to do with this?<br />Welp, I'm out of questions. So I wish you a good week, and good writing.<br />Sayonara! (Goodbye.)<br />REEPER, HUGE apologies for thinking you were a boy! How embarrassing! In answer to your question, the Blue Peter team asked me to blog here for 12 weeks but, now that I've caught the bug, I will be starting up my own blog soon! Vampires and especially pirates HAVE grown on me since I started writing about them. The more I find out about them, the more engrossed I am and keen to weave pirate fact and vampire myth into the stories. And it doesn't stop there. As I've mentioned before, I'm bringing some cowboy history into Blood Captain and I've recently been researching Indian forts for the story. In some ways, I think Vampirates defies or at least blends genres. It's part mystery, part adventure with (hopefully) a good dollop of comedy and even a spot of romance. Whaddya reckon?<br /><br />I love Vampirates one of the most exciting books I've read and that's saying something!<br />JASMINE, thanks for your lovely comment.<br /><br />:) You're welcome!<br />I thought that too - like you said before, it's good to know how your characters would react. It seems strange to say it, but I want to sort of get to know my characters - as if they were real people I'd just met.<br />I have trouble coming up with interesting names for characters, though. How do you come up with the names?<br />:D My story is going to be about pirates! I've always found pirates interesting, so I've always tried to find out a lot about them. I agree, pirate history is very interesting! I'm researching it for my story. <br />Have you ever looked at a book called Pirateology? I find it very good - it has a lot of pirate information in it.<br />Another question for you - what's your favourite book?<br />RACHEL, you were asking about coming up with interesting names. If you're struggling with this, and want to find some unusual ones, a good trick is to watch the credits at the beginning and end of TV shows and jot down any cool names. Play around with swapping first and second names and say them out loud to see how they work. Whenever I sign books, I always note down any unusual names of kids I meet so that I have a ready list to work into the story as and when. I'm constantly coming across scraps of paper with something like "Baribefe" or "Luc" scrawled on it! The character of Joao in Dead Deep was a tribute to a Brazilian boy called Joao who had written to me about the books. (My editor wanted me to change his name as it is hard to pronounce. I had to say "no" to that too given the situation!) No, I haven't read Pirateology yet, though I hear it's very good. My favourite pirate book is an encyclopaedia I bought in the USA. It's called Pirates! An A-Z Encyclopaedia by Jan Rogozinski. I always thought encyclopaedias were a bit boring until I found this. I've got loads of useful stuff from it, including the ideas for Cheng Li and Sidorio. It's fun just to flip through and read sometimes.<br /><br />Hi again! Thanks so much for answering my questions!It seems you put a lot of work into researching pirates. What was one of the most interesting things you found out? When I was reading the first book and found out that it was set in the future I wondered why pirates came back into existence when today there aren't any. What made you want to put it in the future instead of the past? The other day, when I was in language arts we went to the media centre to vote on books to put in our L.A. classrooms. I thought your book might be there, but sadly it wasn't. I'm hoping that more people in the U.S. find out about your book because it's a great read. I've already told many people in my family about it and I'm convincing some of them to read it. Is there any author that you've met, maybe at one of the book fairs that you've been to, that you have become good friends with or will always remember? <br />Thanks for listening and good luck! I can't wait to read the next book, I just have to find out how get it first.<br />DANIELLE, hope you've had a good week! Thanks for getting in touch again and acting as my publicist in the US! One of the most interesting things I found out about pirates was that Roman pirates kidnapped Julius Caesar. As you know, I managed to work that into the story! There ARE pirates around today. And I thought that it made sense to have pirates in the future because, with global warming and sea-level rise, there would be a lot more ocean for them to roam around and whoever controlled those vast oceans would be very powerful indeed!<br /><br />Have a great week, guys, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br />Trust the tide!<br />Justin<br /><br />----<br /><br />Hello again!<br />How's everyone doing? The big news from here is that I'm a little sunburned with a rather short new haircut. Also, I've been doing loads of writing on 'Vampirates: Blood Captain'. Only one month to go until I hand it in, so get ready to send me lots of productive and calming vibes ;-) Actually, this week I wrote the last chapter... so I now know how the book is going to end (and it's a tear-jerker!). But I've still got enough stuff to write in the middle section of the book to keep me busy over the next few weeks.<br /><br />Last week, I talked about the publishing process and I thought I'd do so again this week, as this seems to be an area of interest for a lot of you. Last time, I talked about my editor but that's only one important person at the publisher's. I've talked before about how publishing is a 'team sport' so I thought this week I'd introduce you to some other key members of my team...<br /><br />AGENT - My agent represents me and my work and is the person who did the deal between me and my publisher on 'Vampirates'. Her company has sold the rights in 'Vampirates' to over twenty publishers around the world. Indeed, she's just returned from the Bologna Book Fair in Italy, where she had lots of chats with foreign publishers of 'Vampirates'. Fortunately, they all seem to have been saying nice things! She's also the one talking to movie and TV companies about the books. Sometimes agents sell on to publishers, international publishing and movie rights, in which case the publishers RIGHTS DIRECTOR then sell them on.<br /><br />ART DIRECTOR - The art director works for the publisher and is the person who decides what your book jackets will look like. They talk to the editor and sometimes the author too and come up with an idea for which artist to approach and brief them on the kind of look they'd like. It was my art director's inspired idea to ask Bob Lea to illustrate the 'Vampirates' jackets. Interestingly, my art director approached another company to create the 'Vampirates' logo. I think the logo and Bob's illustrations work brilliantly together. Hope you agree!<br /><br />MARKETING TEAM - These are the guys who come up with great ideas for making you guys aware that my books exist. Their work ranges from commissioning posters and bookmarks for bookshops, to running my website and coming up with cool ideas for competitions etc. They also work very closely with my...<br /><br />PUBLICIST - My publicist plans my tours and appearances at literary festivals etc. She's already worked out about four week's worth of touring around publication of 'Blood Captain' in the autumn. She sorts out everything from deciding where I should go to working out how many kids I can talk to in a day (my personal best is 900 in a day). She also fixes up cool hotels and train times. She is also in charge of pitching me to the media for interviews, appearances and photo-shoots. So, look out, Blue Peter&brvbar; your phones will be ringing once again!<br /><br />SALES TEAM - The sales director and her team are responsible for getting bookshops excited about my books. They talk to the big bookshop chains, as well as independent bookshops, supermarkets and online retailers. The sales guys try to get the bookshops to order as many copies of the books as possible and to get them into all those '3 for 2' promotions and 'Book of the Month' slots that you see when you walk into a book store.<br /><br />I hope I haven't left anyone out!!! (If I have, I'll sneak them in next time!)<br /><br />Now, a few answers to your fiendish questions and choice comments...<br /><br />Hi Justin, me here... AGAIN!!<br />I am really looking forward to reading BLOOD CAPTAIN. Are you getting worried now that you are coming up to the reported deadline (the first blog you said that you have till the end of May.).<br />Something that cropped up in my mind the other day (what with the announcement that the 4th Young Bond book will be published in Hardback rather than Paperback) is have you ever considered publishing VAMPIRATES in hardback? It would be a great marketing ploy as it would be unusual for the series, I hope this doesn't sound offensive as it does when I read it back as VAMPIRATES doesn't need any marketing ploys. Its awesome!<br />Ryan, hi! Am I worried about my deadline? LOL. Let's just say that I'm full of adrenaline. I feel very 'in the zone' with the writing at the moment. You always want more time on a book but equally it's exciting to know that once you've handed it in, it won't be too long before the readers get their hands on it. You also asked about whether I'd like 'Vampirates' to be published in hardback. The answer is that it already is. On my bookshelf, I have hardback editions of the books from the US, Spain, Italy, Norway and Russia. In some countries, such as the US, it comes out first in hardback and then in paperback. In others, Spain for instance, it will only be published in hardback. It's a question of 'different strokes for different folks'. I think publishing straight into paperback in the UK was a sound decision because it means young readers can buy it for themselves with pocket money.<br /><br />Ah, I wouldn't be embarrassed if I were you. Besides, even if I had put my real name, you'd think me to be more of a boy! (Payton)<br />I believe that you'd be right with your genres. It couldn't be better either, cause there the best types to mix together<br />Well, considering we (the Readers, commenter's, ECT) are under 16. How exactly would getting published work? I can see it being different due to that. I assume this would be a better question for a publisher though...<br />I am very anxious to get on with reading Vampirates, but I know that'll be awhile. So do you have any suggestions for the time being?<br />How long does it usually take to write a book?<br />Wow, out of questions...<br />Sorry about that...and there not being a lot said.<br />Might come back with more later.<br />Reeper, a.k.a. Payton, helloo! The simple advice on publishing is a) don't get too hung up on it, b) write something you're really proud of and c) if you want to take it further, start talking to an agent. This is especially true if you're under 16. I can't repeat this enough - it's more important to develop as a writer than to get published immediately. It will stand you in better stead in the long run. As to a book suggestion, that's a tricky one. There's so many good ones out there. I did recently re-read one of my own teen favourites, which is 'The Outsiders' by S E Hinton. If you haven't yet read it, give it a go! Maybe one of the other bloggers here can make another recommendation to you...<br /><br />I am very happy to say that I was able to order Vampirates Dead Deep from the UK. It is supposed to come in about 2 weeks, and am excited to find out what happens next in the story. I was wondering, why does it take so much longer to be published in the book stores in the U.S.? Also, did Vampirates Dead Deep come out before or after Vampirates Tide of Terror? I wanted to know, do you think you'll want to write more then six books if all goes well? Thanks for answering my questions from my last entry and the new blog entry was very helpful, keep writing!<br />Danielle, hello again. I hope 'Dead Deep' is on its way to you as I write. In terms of scheduling, it all depends on what slots publishers have in their schedules, what other books they're planning to publish and when they think is a good moment for a particular book to come out. I appreciate this means you currently have to wait almost a year for the US editions of the books. 'Dead Deep' was published after 'Tide of Terror', even though it is set before it. Right now, I would love to write more than six 'Vampirates' books. The further I go into the story, the more potential I can see for the action spinning off in different directions. We'll just have to see - if my publishers and my readers agree, you never know!<br /><br />How do I become a author of my own book?<br />Gwyinni, hi. You become an author by writing your own story, so the chances are you already are one!<br /><br />Thanks for all the advice about publishing!<br />Ah, ok, I'll keep an eye out for interesting names; thanks!<br />Yes, pirateology is really good. It's a story but it also has a lot of information about pirates. :)<br />Did you want to be an author when you were a child? I want to be an author... but I know it's hard to become established so I'm going to get another job first too! :)<br />Rachel, hi again. Yes, I think I pretty much always wanted to be an author. When I was at secondary school, the author Jan Mark came to do a writing workshop. She advised me to get a job that paid the bills, which was good advice. But do keep writing! It can be hard when you're juggling two jobs, but it's worth it!<br /><br />Hey! Love your books! Keep it up :]<br />I was just wondering, as an author you must check out the competition of other children's authors sometimes. What do you think of the likes of J.K Rowling and her Harry or Phillip Pullman and his Lyra. Also, if your books were turned into a film, how would you feel about auditions open to the public and what kind of people would you like to play certain characters?<br />Emz, hi and thanks for your feedback. I DO read other children's authors, including J K Rowling and Philip Pullman, but not so much to check out the competition but rather because they are really great reads. Sometimes it can be inspiring to read other writers but sometimes you can read them and think 'aargh! I'll never be this good.' If the 'Vampirates' books get made into movies, I think open auditions are a great idea, if only so I can do my best Simon Cowell impersonation ;-)<br /><br />Have a great week, guys, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br />Trust the tide!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, time for a confession! I didn't realise but apparently a good few of you have been leaving messages under my first post as well as the current one, so I've left a few of your questions unanswered. Are you trying to confuse me? Don't you know that technology challenges me at the best of times?! Oh well, I have found your posts now so here, with apologies for the delay, are some answers!<br /><br />i want to write my own book but sometimes I rush into the story too much and don't know what to write; could you give me some tips?<br />ERIN, it sounds like it might help you to plan out your stories a bit. It's always tempting to just get into the writing (and sometimes that's the right thing to do) but try jotting down the 'arc' of the story you think you want to tell. Where does it begin? Where does it end? What are the key turning points in the middle? You could even number the key points in your storyline, say 1-10. You can flesh this out further and further until you feel if you don't write something soon, you'll burst! Good luck!<br /><br />Hey! Thanks for replying to my comment, when you become incredibly famous I shall be pointing at the TV and going "He commented me!" hehe.<br />Right, so calming advise. I guess I should know this as I'm revising for my SATS and was really nervous but I think I'm under control now!<br />Try and think positive! Glare at a mirror and tell yourself "this book is GOOD! It will do WELL! My readers will LOVE it!" you may feel a bit stupid but it helps get you feeling more positive and might even make you laugh which is always good! :]<br />Before the big day, treat yourself! Indulge in something like a big bar of chocolate whilst watching one of your favourite films, or doing one of your hobbys like reading...or fishing if that's your thing! Spend lots of time outside when possible as the weather is lovely (Well where I am) and visit different places with great views to look at.<br />I'm sure you know all this, but just thought I'd say anyway!<br />Aaand! Are you considering writing another series or book after Vampirates? I hope you do! Especially if it was different from Vampirates, so could maybe gain a different type of audience as Vampirates may not be some people's kind of thing!<br />EMZ, big thanks for the great advice on keeping calm! I've been putting them into practice. Good luck with your upcoming SATs!<br /><br />Hi Justin, I am happy to say that Vampirates Dead Deep came to my house two days ago! At first when I opened the box I thought they forgot to put it in, but then after I shuffled through the paper inside I found it. It's much smaller then I thought it was! I am going to start reading it after I finish the book I'm reading now. It's so great to read about news on movies. lol. I know you have to focus on the books right now, but it's good to know that you're thinking about it! How did you really get started as an author? Did you start paying an agent and then she found the rest of the team? Or did you try to get your book published first? The new blog entry was really helpful, I never knew that there were so many people involved. If I try out for the movie, if you do end up making one after you finish the books, you can be a Puala Abdul to me =) (I'm watching American Idol right now, Bon Jovi is preforming) hehe. Well, if I think of any more questions I'll be sure to write!<br />DANIELLE, glad that 'Dead Deep' arrived. Yes, it's only a little book but it was only one pound! Hope you enjoy it anyhow, just read it s-l-o-w-l-y! You're right in that I did start by hiring an agent and she then kind of found the rest of the team. I knew that the best chance of getting the book published was with her on board.<br /><br />What is it like after you publish a book? I see that you travel a little, but how about after that? Do you get straight onto the next book, or do you get a little bit of a break?<br />It would be so cool to see Vampirates as a book or tv series. The only thing about that is that they choose such cheesy voices for the characters now'a days!<br />Ok, I shall give the book a try, it looks interesting (How about it guys, any ideas? I'm up for anything that doesn't involve talking dogs...) I would suggest "As Simple As Snow" by Gregory Galloway to anyone wanting a really good read.<br />Have you ever lost what you were writing? You probably have to backup a lot, does this become a "pain"?<br />Book-How did Darcy "cross"? She doesn't seem to know really, but then when you read about how Jez "crossed", its kinda of confusing.<br />More Book- Bart sure seems to love his tea. Is this an Australian thing, or does the Diablo come from somewhere with tea-lovers (Because they serve tea). At first I thought it might be set in Southern U.S. because of that, then I realised you were from the U.K, and a lot of people say you guys love your tea.<br />REEPER, you were asking what happens after I hand in the new book. Good question! Well, I'll hand it in at the end of this month. My editor will then have a read and we'll work through any rewrites by the end of June (not much time when you think about it!). The book will then go off to be typeset and I'll have a bit of a mental break from 'Vampirates'. As you know, I'm heading off to Australia in July. When I come back, I'll start publicity for 'Blood Captain' leading up to publication in September. I'm then spending almost all of October on tour. So I probably won't actually start writing Book Four in earnest until the end of 2007 but I'll be storing up ideas, doing some research and starting to plot it out in the meantime.<br /><br />Hi! Justin I love the books and I can't get enough of them! I'm wandering how long Vampirates series will last? Is this the end? also I would like to tell you I'm writing a long story about vampires and I'm hoping if you could give me any tips for characters.<br />Hi its me again! I know you haven't posted a comment back yet but I couldn't wait!I just forgot to ask you, when you first started writing your book did you ever feel that it would be awful and that it wouldn't be successful. I am writing my first big story and that sometime, maybe, when I'm older I could publish it out perhaps? But when I'm writing it now I think to my self "Oh, this is boring!" Or "People wouldn't like this!" I just want to know how do you get the inspiration for the cool plots in the Vampirates! <br />Hope you are well and all my luck to Blood Captain I think it would be FANTASTIC! <br />LORCAN RULES (AKA RHOSYN), I think like most authors I have plenty of moments of thinking 'this is awful!' and 'will people like it?' The other thing with a continuing sequence like 'Vampirates' is that readers get very strong ideas about the characters so there's the added danger that people will be cross at me for putting a character through some horrible situation or even killing them off! But that isn't going to stop me ;-)<br /><br />I love your books they are so cool!! I was really unhappy when Jez got killed in the second Vampirates book!! However I still really enjoyed it! In the future I aspire to be a great writer and reading your books has taught me a lot. It is great the way you end some of the chapters with cliff hangers. The captain of the Vampirates ship is amazing, he seems so mysterious and evil in the shanty yet when Grace meets him he is very kind and gentle but still mysterious!!<br />CLIO12, thanks for your great feedback. Don't count out Jez just yet! He just might be more resilient than you think.<br /><br />I really love your books and hope to be as good as you one day. I love to write, sadly though with school in the way I don't get as much time as I would hope! :( but still I can certainly find the time to read Vampirates... and then I can't put it down but oh well! I am not complaining! :)<br />i really love your work. that's all I can say. I am sure you have found yourself in the position of knowing what to say but not being able to find the right words... well maybe you have and maybe you have not but that's how I am now... can't find the right words. :) <br />guess I can say this... you are one of my top fave authors! :)<br />LUPIN_WEREWOLF, hi! Thanks for saying such nice things. Yes, trust me, I do know what it's like to be lost for words!<br /><br />when did you start writing?<br />5WHITEA, you wanted to know when I started writing. The answer is I've pretty much always written ever since I was very young. The trick - if you want to become a writer - is just never to stop!<br /><br />Your book is so so so so great. I cannot wait till your next books come out.  Thanks<br />FOOTYGIRL12313, HOWLIE MONKIE, CRAIG and madmilk, thanks to you all for the compliments! It's readers like you who help make the writing so rewarding.<br /><br />Have a great week, all of you, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br />Trust the tide!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, hope you've all had a good week. I've been hard at work writing. Not long to go now! I thought I might talk some more about the act of writing itself this week. One thing that people very much fall into two camps over is writing dialogue. Some find it really easy to write dialogue; some find it really tough. I think, like all other aspects of writing, the answer is practise!<br /><br />I really enjoy dialogue and, as you may have noticed, use it a lot in my stories. I think it's a great way of developing a character and I try to give mine a distinctive way of talking so that I can drop a few "he said" or "Connor said" from the text. Ideally, I want you to be able to easily follow who's talking, just as if you were watching a movie or TV show. One easy way to do this is to give a character a word that they tend to use and other characters don't. For instance, my Aussie pirate Bart often calls his friends "Buddy" so if that word appears, it's generally safe to assume it's him. And, in the new book, I have a Norwegian pirate who uses expression, "min elskling" ("my dear" in, you guessed it, Norwegian). Obviously you don't want to overdo this.<br /><br />I think that dialogue is a great way of moving a story forward quickly. It's quick to read and, for that matter, write. But, as with all your writing, you must have a look at it once you've done it and check that it "serves" your story. Rambling dialogue is as tedious on the page as it is in life!<br /><br />With dialogue, you just can't beat good research. And the best research you can do is simply to listen to how people talk. Think how clever Catherine Tate was to pick up that phrase "am I bovvered" which is exactly how a certain kind of person does talk. Just by listening to your dad, teacher, people on the bus or in a caf&eacute;, you could pick up something just as useful.<br /><br />Of course, when you write dialogue in a story, you'll want to ditch most of those "ums", "ers" and false starts that we all pepper our sentences with. Use these sparingly for when you really want to show someone having difficulty getting something out.<br /><br />Oh, and one final thought on all this... don't always have characters say what they are thinking or wanting in their dialogue. It's often more interesting if they say one thing but we know - or suspect - that they really mean the opposite. For instance, you might have one character ask "does my bum look big in this?" and another respond, "erm, no... NO! You look great!" The slight delay and then the over-compensation tells us the true story.<br /><br />Now, time to talk about the questions you've sent in this week...<br /><br />That's strange, most blogs tell you when you have news comments though, so you don't have to worry about missing one.<br />Let the mind rest, in other words. Sounds quit interesting Do you ever get tired of doing all the things a writer does? Such as publicity, and travel? Do you usually take anyone with you, animals, family, friends.<br />Where is your publicist sending you?<br />REEPER, I think that getting out and about and meeting fans is one of the great perks of this job. Who wouldn't want to travel places to talk about their work and hear from people who really enjoy what you're doing?! I've also been lucky to go onto radio and TV shows (including Blue Peter!) to talk about my book, which is a great way to reach new readers. Frankly, I could do this kind of publicity all the time but there is the thorny issue of actually writing the books - which I enjoy very much too. It's true though that I'm in a rather different mindset when I'm out and about touring (very showman, extrovert) and when I'm writing (quiet, unshaven, hermit-like... I'm exaggerating just a little) so I like to ringfence writing time rather than mixing up the two. I generally go on tour with my ace publicist Penny or someone else from the marketing team. On one occasion, I took my Mum with me for the weekend, which was fun for us both (I think!).<br /><br />Thanks for all the information about publishing.<br />How easy is it for a new writer to get published without an agent, though? And, how would you go about getting an agent?<br />RACHEL, it's tricky - but not impossible - to get published without an agent. If and when you're looking for an agent, a good source of info is a book called 'The Writers and Artists Yearbook' which is published annually. Amongst other things, this lists out agents' names and even tells you what kinds of authors they represent. Most - but not all - children's book authors are represented by agents who specialise in children's books.<br /><br />I hope that you don't loose any of your comments again. It's really nice that you went back to answer them. I'm on the last chapter in my book and am excited to read Vampirates, I'll probably start reading it tomorrow or Saturday. I'll try to read it slowly, but I usually get into where I can't stop reading. I do hope that one day you'll be able to come to the U.S on tour. Any chance of that happening in the future? Besides writing, is there anything else that you're really into and enjoy, such as sports or other hobbies? What's the longest you've ever been on tour, or going to be? Who decides where you go on tour? Well, out of questions, write back soon!<br />DANIELLE, I would LOVE to come on tour to the US. If the books continue to sell well over there, I'm sure it will happen! (That's my not-so-subtle way of saying spread the word to all your friends :-)) In terms of sports/hobbies... I have to say that it's quite hard finding time for them at the moment. That said, I try to swim as often as possible and I'd like to get in some tennis this summer. I moved house about six months ago and I have my own garden for the first time so I'm really enjoying that. Mostly though, I like chilling out with friends, especially in my garden (spot any theme here?). And I really - big surprise - love reading (in my garden!). I think that my tour this autumn will be the most number of days so far. It's pretty much the whole of October, but I think the most I'm on the road at any one time would be about five days, which means I can get home and do my washing in between ;-)<br /><br />thank you for commenting back. Yes I try to base some of my characters for people to really like them and yes I do really get attached to your characters! But I hope you don't kill anyone except Sidorio of couse! LOL<br />RHOSYN, I can't promise that I won't kill off a key character or two in the course of this. When you're a pirate, it's all too easy to get brought down in battle. Of course, it's a bit trickier killing vampires, but even so...! Strictly speaking, Sidorio IS dead. If you remember, in 'Tide of Terror', he was on the burning ship attacked by Connor and the other pirate crews. Will he rise again in 'Blood Captain'? Erm, I can't tell you that. You'll have to find out for yourself later this year.<br /><br />i love reading books I find them really interesting but I have a problem, what shall I read next please give me a suggestion I'm 9 and have read Anne Frank and HARRY POTTER THE GOBLET OF FIRE okay well BYE.<br />BBOOKK, thanks for your post. I think I'm going to ask your fellow bloggers here to suggest a top read for you. So come on guys... what would you recommend for this book-hungry nine year-old? (BBOOKK, I'm assuming - of course! - that you've read ALL the 'Vampirates' books?!)<br /><br />Have a great week, all of you, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br />Trust the tide!<br />Justin<br /><br />----<br /><br />Hi guys, how's tricks?<br />I was so sorry to hear the news about the fire on board the Cutty Sark. Whether it was started intentionally or by accident, it's really sad and shocking. At the time of me writing this, they are saying that the ship can be saved, which is great news. It's a blessing really that the mast and other key artefacts were off-site as part of the renovation of the ship. I was lucky enough to visit the Cutty Sark a couple of times last year - once to an event and once to do some filming for 'Blue Peter'! My pictures this week are from those visits. I found being on the ship really inspiring and hope to get back on board once it is restored.<br /><br />This week, I thought I'd share with you the shape of my writing day. I do most of my writing in the mornings. I like to get to my desk by 8:30 am. I've tried both earlier and later but an 8:30 am start seems to deliver the best results. I'm usually awake around 7:00 am and quite often I'll have a cup of tea in bed and perhaps think through the chapter(s) I want to work on today. When I get up, I don't go straight into my office. I walk to my local high street, which is about 10 minutes. There I pick up a coffee and blueberry muffin (healthy eating has to wait until the book is finished!). I then make another stop, closer to home, for some bottles of water. Then, loaded with supplies, I head home to start writing.<br /><br />Of course, the walk is not simply about getting coffee etc. I could make coffee at home. But I like to get out into the air, partly to feel like I'm actually going to work and partly because a short walk gives my brain a chance to wake up and start gearing up for the job ahead.<br /><br />Back in my office, I have a book with a different Buddhist saying for each day of the year. I like to turn the page and think about what it says each day. Today it said "be crazy in your own way", which is great advice for a writer on any day!<br /><br />I then switch on my computer and get going. I might jot down a few brief notes on scenes, or pieces of information, I want to include in a chapter. Then I type straight onto the screen. I'm a two-finger typist, but surprisingly fast! I generally try to write a draft of the whole chapter in one go. I view this a bit like a sketch. Once I get the bare bones down, I can then spend as long as I want adding flesh to it. It's all about trying to bring it closer and closer to what I've imagined and make it as true as I can from every character's perspective. Sometimes this happens surprisingly quickly; sometimes it takes more effort.<br /><br />I always print the drafts of the chapter off onto paper so I can read them from paper rather than on-screen and make notes in coloured pen. I'm afraid I do keep doing this quite a lot. I seem to need to hold the chapter in my hand, rather than view it on screen, to get a proper feel for it. It's hard to say how many drafts a chapter goes through, because I go through it any number of times, making small changes. Of course, it doesn't always flow so smoothly and I may have to drastically rework it on another day.<br /><br />I do set myself targets of how much I want to write but this varies a lot depending on how far into the book - and how close to my deadline I am. I'm generally happy if I've written 1500 good words in a morning. Sometimes I can manage 3000 or more. Other days, there are very few good words indeed!<br /><br />In the afternoons, I get on my with my other job, as well as doing things like writing blogs and answering fanmail. I try to work some "dead time" into my day too, whether it's swimming, going for another walk or just sitting quietly. I find increasingly that a little bit of dead time is invaluable in getting the brain ready to begin again the next day. It's a bit like recharging your laptop or phone, I guess. The brain is a bit like a battery!<br /><br />Now, onto the questions you've sent in this week.... <br /><br />Oh yes I've forgot. He is practically dead!<br />Yesterday Film stars were filming in a town near me which is really rare. Keira Knightley was one of them and I was excited to see her. But she didn't even wave unlike Sienna Miller who did. I was really disappointed that she didn't wave or anything. Have you ever met a person you really liked but when you meet them you start to get disappointed?<br />Also I knew you wanted to be an actor as I do when you were younger. Did you get any parts?<br />RHOSYN, hello again! I'm glad Sienna Miller gave you a wave! Yes I have met a famous person who I admired but wasn't very nice in the flesh - but I'm not naming names! I've also met some really lovely famous people - including the Blue Peter presenters. I guess people are people. As you say, I did briefly entertain thoughts of being an actor when I was younger. I kept hoping I'd get discovered and would end up in some big new movie version of 'Oliver!' or some such. Did it happen? No, I am STILL waiting to be "discovered"! (Maybe if 'Vampirates' becomes a movie, I'll get a walk-on part!)<br /><br />Hmm, one thing I don't like about reading about books online, is that, they usually tell you things that the author probably didn't want to be told yet. Such as...Sidorio...rising again.<br />BBOOKK- Depending on your reading level...<br />I'll suggest "The Shakespeare Series"****<br />Its read is similar to Vampirates. Don't worry, they don't speak like "Where art thou, my beloved. Hast you be in thy Garden?"<br />Something smaller to read is "Ghosts I have been" The end isn't that great, but its pretty good.<br />****The Shakespeare Series is three books long. You can actually buy all three of them in one big hardback.(It makes you look like you read a lot!!! :-p)<br />Your garden must be pretty big...Flowers, or fruits and veggies?<br />It would be so cool to do that in a job, of course. What would you say your favourite place to visit has been?<br />I read that getting published without an agent can be risky. Because you'd have to get it printed by yourself. Then get places to sell it for you. You'd be spending your own money. ECT.<br />I shall say, I am the person that cannot write dialogue well. I'd rather explain the scenery...XD<br />Well, I shall be going. Summers almost here and that means you gotta do a lot, to play a lot REEPER, thanks as ever for your comments. My garden is pretty small so flowers rather than fruits. Most importantly though, there is now a table and chairs in it so I was actually able to sit and write outside last week (between rainstorms!).<br /><br />The story that I finished writing in January, when I went back and read it through, I did see that in some parts I did do where the characters say what they think in their dialogue I'll try not too do it so much in the story I'm writing now (thanks for the tip!) I started reading Vampirates Dead Deep I'm anxious to get to Grace and the Vampirates.  I was a little confused in the part when Connor saw the arm wrestling girl, Kally, pull from out under the table and had no visible legs. When you described what he saw wasn't sure what you meant("Her legs were hidden in an oilskin bag fastened at the waist with a cord")It took a few moments to figure it out, but I'm pretty sure what it means now. Have you ever looked back on one of your books and thought, I could've done that differently? Me and the other people that comment on this site always ask you questions, but if you could ask one of your favourite authors a question what might it be? Do you have a favourite author or book? Do you have any questions you'd like to ask your fans?<br />DANIELLE, hello! Yes, I do sometimes look back on bits of books and think that I could have written something differently and indeed better. I try not to get TOO hung up on this, though as it's not really an option for me, is it? ;-) I think the most important thing is to feel that you're developing as a writer. I think I am and I think I'm doing things in the new book, say, that I wouldn't have been able to do in the first book. One of my favourite books is 'Cloudstreet' by Tim Winton. I absolutely love it. I wrote to the author and he sent me a signed postcard, which I keep in the book as a bookmark. The book is set in Western Australia, where I will be in July (can't wait!) so I'm planning on re-reading it either before I go or when I'm out there. You also asked if I have any questions for my fans? The answer is YES! I find it enormously helpful to know what you are enjoying reading - in my books and other people's. What books do you enjoy reading? Do you have a favourite fictional character? Let me know by commenting on this blog!<br /><br />Hi Justin. I'm really looking forward to reading BLOOD CAPTAIN. Roll on September!<br />Anyway, do you yet know, roughly as I know you haven't completely finished yet, how many pages and/or words BLOOD CAPTAIN will be?<br />My mum and dad have said that I can come see you when you go on tour in October and it'll be great as I'll get to meet you (a writing hero!) and get you to sign my copies of the books.<br />RYAN, my man! Good to hear from you again. I'm afraid I still can't tell you how long 'Blood Captain' will be yet. I reckon at least as long as 'Tide of Terror' but possibly longer. It very much depends what happens when my editor gets her hands on it later this week!!! Looking forward to meeting you in October!<br /><br />Have a great week, all of you, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br />Trust the tide!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, how's everyone doing?<br />Two pieces of good news this week! Firstly I have finished the first draft of 'Blood Captain'. Result! As you'll see from the first photo, it's a hefty beast. (And it makes a very good pillow!)<br /><br />Now I'm sure all of you like to hand in your homework nice and early every time, right? Well, not me! I like to leave it until the very last minute. In the end, I sent over to my editor the first half of the book last Thursday (so she could start reading it over that very wet and windy Bank Holiday weekend). Then I sent over the remainder yesterday, having worked on some final bits and pieces over the weekend.<br /><br />When I say 'sent', I simply attached the document to an e-mail and whizzed it off into hyperspace. You might think that it's a bit of an anticlimax to e-mail it rather than plonk it down on my ed's desk, but it's a whole lot easier to be honest. And it saves a lot of paper and ink.<br /><br />Coming to the end of a (draft of a) book is rather strange. I build the book up in chunks of chapters of about 1500-2000 words each. As you know, I have a plan, which shows me how those chapters fit together to make the whole jigsaw. But as I was copying each chapter into one big file, and intertwining the adventures of Connor and Grace, I did feel suddenly nervous. I was pleased with the individual chapters but would it work overall? The truth is, as my good friend Graham, another writer, reminded me - you're just too close to the book at this point to be able to judge. So I just got on with it and decided to wait to hear what my editor and agent say. Keep your fingers crossed, guys!<br /><br />It's a bit sad finishing a book and knowing that you're writing the last - for now - scene featuring a particular character. It feels a bit like saying goodbye to your mates, because I've been living at close quarters with these characters for the past six months. At this point, I'm always so pleased that I have more books to go in the sequence so I know I'll be able to play with these characters again soon. And as I came to the end of writing, I had a rush of ideas about the story of the next book. That happened to me at this point with 'Tide of Terror'. It's a good feeling.<br /><br />The other thing that happens when you finish a book is that you feel pretty exhausted. As the second pic shows, I've been more than ready to catch up on my Zs - but not quite ready to let it out of my clutches!<br /><br />The second piece of good news is that this is NOT my last blog on the Blue Peter site. The nice people at Blue Peter have asked me to carry on blogging for another few weeks until the end of the current run of the TV show. So I'm afraid you haven't seen the back of me yet! Should be fun to talk to you about how the edit of 'Blood Captain' goes.<br /><br />Now, onto the comments and questions you've sent in this week.... <br /><br />Wow, I can't believe how much it'll cost to restore it! I never could understand why restoring something would be so expensive...after all, you can't really use old material. It is very fortunate though that they had tooken most of its structure out.....<br />That must be nice. My backyard is turning into a pretty nice place to sit and read. If we had a cover over the swing, I'd probably be out there during storms as well<br />Well, times almost here for you to finish the book. Are you excited? I always felt like it was a good accomplishment when I would get farther into writing a book, or even a chapter. When it was finished though, I couldn't help but wonder if it was enough.<br />What was it like when you first started writing? You probably hadn't figured all the tips and such that you know now. Was it any harder? Easier?<br />I was watching something on pirates the other day, and it said why they were probably so keen on rum. Apparently its because it didn't go bad like water or all of their preserves. So it brought a question to me. How exactly does the Nocturne get their food? The Diablo stops at Ma Kettles a lot, so I can see how they do.<br />Do you have a favourite snack to keep you in the mood for writing?<br />Reeper, hi! Lots of great questions, as ever, from you. Good info about the rum. I've heard that too. Which favourite snack keeps me in the mood for writing? I'd have to say the latte and blueberry muffin, which I pick up each morning before writing. Now the book is finished, I'm swearing off the muffins for the moment. We'll see how long that lasts :-)<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear about the ship but glad that some things were saved! Well, of course my favourite book is Vampirates and I really like the characters Lorcan and Grace. Other then Vampirates, I enjoy the Series of Unfortunate Events books. Sadly, I finished the last book in October My favourite character in that book is Violet and Count Olaf. Those are the two books that are my favourite and I'm still searching for another GREAT read like them. I just bought a few more books that I will start reading after I'm done with Vampirates Dead Deep, and waiting for the next Vampirates to come out. I am so glad you find time during the day to write to us on this blog, it means a lot. Seems like writing chapters during the day takes a lot of going over the same thing again and again; I see why it takes so long. Do you always work on your books at home? Is there a favourite spot of yours in your house or somewhere else that helps you think and feel very concentrated? I never really knew what Blue Peter was, what exactly is it? A company or...? When you said you went to the ship to film, what was it you were filming? After a day of writing how do you usually feel? Do you feel like it was worth it or you feel like you didn't do enough? Thanks for listening! =)<br />Danielle, hello again! I'm glad you're enjoying the blog. I am too. It's much less work and much more fun than I thought it would be. I do almost all my writing at home in my new(ish) office. It's very much my space for writing. As mentioned in my first blogs, I've got a wall plastered with images copied from books and magazines to inspire me and I also have my trusty dictionary and Roget's Thesaurus to hand, as well as shelves of reference books about pirates, vampires, cowboys etc etc! After a day of writing, I usually feel pretty productive. Even if what I've written ends up getting cut (by me or my editor) it will usually have helped me to explore the world of my story and perhaps led me to a realisation about a character or about how to make a scene better or more exciting.<br /><br />How many Vampirate books are you hoping to write?<br />Rhosyn, hello again! No celeb sightings this week, then?! Yes, villains are fun to read and great fun to write. How many 'Vampirates' books am I planning to write? At least six. I've already got a few ideas for Book Four.<br /><br />I'm back! Anyway, just a bizarre question I know but...<br />If you had to go on an Dessert Island...what 5 objects/food/people would you take and what would be your reasons?<br />Emz, welcome back! Was that one question you asked or 15? I'm not sure! At this point, having just finished writing 'Blood Captain', I think a spell on a desert island would suit me very well. I'd take my five closest friends (they know who they are!). My five objects would be a snorkel + mask, sun-lotion, sunnies, a really comfy sunlounger to read in and my Scrabble set. Food-wise, we'd catch fish and have lots of barbecues but I'd take a few spices and other things to whip up a great marinade!<br /><br />Hey Justin. Well, June is a few days away. OMG! As I type this it is the 28th May so only 3 more days left. Or has the deadline already passed? Mmmm...<br />Anyway. I am really looking forward to Blood Captain and knowing that you are now completing it feels a little odd. I'm a writer too and am hoping to find an agent in the not too distant future, and as a write, I appreciate all the work that goes into a book. The reason it feels odd is because I can't help myself thinking about what you are writing right now, this second. With some authors its hard because they don't speak about their schedule and even deadlines. With you though, its fun to know as you can think, 'is Justin killing a character right now?' 'is Justin now writing a huge fight scene?' etc.<br />That leads me to my next bit... Do any characters die in Blood Captain. Of course, you can't say who but can you give us a clue? I was shocked when Jez was killed because we hadn't seen a lot of the NORMAL Jez. I do like how he became a Vampirate though. Very cunning. Lol.<br />Anyway, I got to go now as my time on the computer is running out and my sister sits nudging me for her turn.<br />Ryan, last bit not least! Thanks, as ever, for your thoughts. It was a bit nerve-wracking to be honest sharing details of my deadline with you guys. But I thought it would be interesting to open out the publishing process a bit and show you what really goes on. We often hear about authors writing away in attic rooms but, as I hope I'm showing, it's not quite like that. Do any characters die in 'Blood Captain'? I have to be a bit careful answering questions like those as some readers are very keen to have that kind of info but others aren't. So I'm going to keep schtum for now ;-) I know what you mean about Jez. I know he died quite soon after meeting him in 'Tide of Terror'. In retrospect, perhaps it would have been handy to have him appear in 'Demons of the Ocean' (maybe I need to do a new Director's Cut of 'Demons'!) but actually I quite like the way that you're just getting to know him when he dies. It demonstrates the brutality of the world of piracy in the books. And, as you say, we get to know Jez more after he crosses.<br /><br />Have a great week, all of you, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br /><br />This week I've got a question for you as well ... lots of people ask me about turning 'Vampirates' into a movie. I want to hear your views on books vs movies. Do you enjoy seeing your fave books like Stormbreaker, Harry Potter and Narnia being made into movies? Do the movies live up to the books? Are the movies a good representation of the books for fans coming to the story fresh? Does a not-so-great movie put you off going back to the books? Your thoughts on this subject please!<br />Trust the tide!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, how are you all?<br />Thanks for all your postings this week. Lots of great questions from you so let's get straight down to it ...<br /><br />I was just wondering if you could answer some of my questions, you may not be able to but it would be great if you could! (I'm starting with the important questions!!)
 What do you do if people give you negative feedback because I want to be an author but when I get people saying the don't like my stories I want to chuck it in the bin? Could you give me some advice to deal with this?
 When is the best time to get ideas because some days my mind stops and I just can't think of anything at all, is there some way to help this? 
d lastly: 3. When did you start writing? Just a small question I've always wondered.<br />Well good luck and keep writing no matter what!!!!<br />LOLLIPOP, some great questions from you. Firstly, you asked what I do if people give me negative feedback "because I want to be an author but when I get people saying they don't like my stories I want to chuck it in the bin".<br /><br />What an interesting question! I think the first thing to say is that we've all been there. As a writer, putting stories out "into the ether", we open ourselves up for feedback, both positive and negative. It's great when people say nice things about our work but, for some reason, one negative comment seems to outweigh ten or more rave reviews. That's just human nature!<br /><br />Personally, I think it's always worth listening to feedback of both kinds. It's not always comfortable receiving criticism but there may be something useful to learn from it. I find reading what fans - or non fans! - are saying about my books on Amazon and other sites is generally helpful. I've gained useful feedback on characters and storylines. But I think it would be wrong to be a slave to this.<br /><br />As a writer, you have to strike the write balance between writing the way you believe and feel is right and writing to please other people. Yes, we want as many people as possible to enjoy our work, but we can never please EVERYONE! Maybe your story just didn't appeal to one of your mates. But maybe other friends of yours would really like it. My advice to all you budding authors out there is to develop a "second skin". I'm working hard on that myself.<br /><br />LOLLIPOP, you had two other questions. When is the best time to get ideas? I've got two thoughts on that. Firstly, work out when you reckon you're at your most creative and - if you can - clear some "ideas time" then. For instance, my creative brain seems much stronger first thing in the morning and experience has shown I'm better at solving problems in my stories at that time than, say, my low point mid-afternoon. The other answer is to find an activity that helps clear your head and encourages the ideas to flow. My top three are 1) swimming, 2) going for a walk and 3) being on a long train journey.<br /><br />You also asked when I started writing. I think about age four!<br /><br />I like the idea of seeing an amazing book being turned into a film. Sometimes after reading a brill book, you can imagine them making good movies. I think Vampirates would make awesome movies. But I do try not to get to hyped up because as the movie adaptation of Eragon by Christopher Paolini proved a massive disappointment I don't want to see a brilliant book be butchered. I like when they are true to the books. Rather like the Harry Potter films although some things are added and changed, they are roughly accurate.<br />I've got two questions Justin:<br />1) Which of the three Vampirates books you have written is your favourite. Michelle Paver, the author of the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series said when I met her that it is always the book which she has just completed. Are you the same?<br />2) Which of the three Vampirates books you have written do you feel, personally, would make the best movie? Out of the two we can read, I think Tide of Terror as it comes on leaps and bounds from Demons of the Ocean.<br />Anyway, have a good week and its awesome that you get to stay longer!<br />RYAN, hello again. Which of my books is my favourite? Yes, I think I would agree with Michelle Paver (lovely lady, by the way) in that my fave book is the one I have just finished or am working on ... so the answer is 'Blood Captain'! However, I am also curiously fond of 'Dead Deep'. Which of my books would make the best movie? I think that because of the continuing story arc, a movie team would probably want to take the first three or four books together rather than just adapting one book. I think that would deliver a more satisfying story. That said, I think it would be really interesting to develop a fresh story for a movie, which brought new and existing fans into the lives of the characters from a different angle.<br /><br />In answer to your question, I think in some ways, books as films are GREAT as some people (and younger children) find it difficult to read books, which is a shame as it means they have to miss out on great books like yours. But some films are not done very good and therefore completely mess up the book! But I think you should defiantly look into having Vampirates made into a film! And have open auditions for the roles! I think its great that everyone can have a chance to be in it, not just stage school starlets!<br />EMZ, thanks for your comments re: movies. Now, shall I sign you up for Grace or Cheng Li auditions?<br /><br />Ah, 
hink books are usually better than movies. I've watched a movie called Interview With The Vampire before, and it wasn't near as good as the book. Yet they captured it so well!<br />Narnia, I only read the first book. Yet the movie went onto the second book. I didn't so much like that.<br />Glad to hear the book is off to the editor. Though, what happens if you're looking at the manuscript while your editor is editing/reading it, but you decide to change it? Are you pretty much stuck, or is she/he open to suggestions and changes?<br />My friend and I were talking the other day about writing books, and how we can never get anything done, no matter how good the idea. So she had mentioned us writing a book she had an idea for, I agreed but once I read the first chapter she wrote to give me an idea of what's next, I realised that we have two COMPLETLY different styles. So how could this work? Chances are the book will never make it to a third chapter. It still brought up this question though.<br />You said you were starting a blog after you finish this one, right? Well, why is it you can't keep this one? Are you going to go to another site for blogging, or did you decide to not do it anymore? Will you stay here?<br />Anyways, summers here for me and I had a very funny adventure yesterday with my friend. I think I shall write it down and maybe make it part of a book one day, or something like that.<br />Have a nice week.<br />REEPER, howdy! Again, thanks for the comments re: movies. You asked me what happens if I want to change my manuscript while my editor is reading it. Very good question. The answer is that having temporarily stopped work on the book, I have - of course - had a few ideas for changes. I can talk to my editor about these when we have our next meeting. Editing is a very collaborative process. At this point, I want to hear what SHE thinks and where she thinks the book needs extra oomph. Then we''ll work together to find ways to improve it.<br /><br />You also asked about writing a book with your friend but finding that you have very different styles. That's intriguing. One answer would be just to forget it and each write your own stuff but, hey, I'm no quitter! Why don't you each write the book but from different character's points of view. There are a couple of cool books written by Paula Danziger and Ann M Martin in this way - P.S. 'Longer Letter Later' and 'Snail Mail No More'. They're perhaps a bit young for you, but worth looking at for the technique. The two authors had very different personalities and this was reflected in the characters and how they wrote. Give it a try!<br /><br />Hello I was just wondering if you'd answer some of my questions.
I love writing and I have a really good book idea but I can't get my idea into words. How do you do that?<br />SIRJUDOON, hello and welcome! You say you have a really good book idea but can't get it into words. Hmm, that's a tricky one. But I wonder if your sticking point is that you're not that comfortable with writing a traditional story. If that's the case, think about some other options. You could for instance try it as a script (especially if you like dialogue) or if you have a very strong visual sense, why not try creating a graphic novel or manga style version? But really the best advice is to READ! Reading lots of different kinds of things by different authors is probably the very best way to learn how to "get your idea into words". Good luck! Let me know how you get on!<br /><br />Hello Justin
's great to hear that you've finished your rough draft of Blood Captain, I can't wait for it to come out! I'm glad that you'll be able to put in more blog entries 
w, in the picture of Blood Captain it looks very long. How do you keep yourself motivated and keep yourself from not stopping to write until the story is complete? I always have this problem when I'm trying to write a long story. Luckily I finished one of them which I've told you about ("The Ages") But recently I've started another which I have a good idea for it's just I never seem to work on it. (I'm hoping tonight I work on it if I don't get side tracked on something else)
out your question, for me when I see a movie I really like such as, The Series of Unfortunate Events, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Interview with the Vampire (which I just watched AGAIN today) I go out to the store and buy the books! It makes me interested to know the whole story and the continuation. (remember when I said I read all the Series of Unfortunate Events books. I probably would have never started to even read them and finish them if it wasn't for the movie.) It gives the public a good idea of what your books are like and if they like the story line. If they are craving for more information they are likely to read the novel, even if you come out with a new continuation movie. I think that if you made Vampirates into a movie with open auditions it gives great opportunity to the lovers of the books. Vampirates, I think, would defiantly capture the attention of many people. (But you'll have to beat Pirates of the Caribbean! just kidding!) 
's different for every movie I see, for example, I like the movie Chronicles of Narnia better then the book, I liked the book better then the movie for Series of Unfortunate Events, for Interview with the Vampire(I do hope to finish one day), and Harry Potter, the books were so long I started them but never finished. I like your books because they're the right length and I'm so interested with them that I read the whole thing even if it's very long, but for example, people may think that books such as Harry Potter are too long, and the movie is just faster to watch. But please, if you have the opportunity to make this fantastic novel into a feature film DO IT. I'm sure you won't regret it. You'll be able to share the story with movie goers and book lovers.
anks for reading!<br />DANIELLE, hello again! You asked how I keep motivated when writing a long story. To be honest, it can be challenging. You have to get your mindset like that of a runner training for the marathon. Things like having a story plan helps because you can break down a big story into more approachable chunks. I have a postcard stuck on my window, with a quote from the painter Vincent van Gogh. It reads "great things are a series of small things brought together". Whenever I get stressed about the size of a novel, I focus on that and it helps a bit.<br /><br />Have a great week, all of you, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br /><br />Oh and I have another question for you... We're hearing a lot about "Books for Boys" at the moment. My own book 'Tide of Terror' has just appeared on a book list to get "Boys Into Books". What do you guys think about this? Is there a big difference between the books boys like and girls like? If so, what IS the difference? Is it the content of the books? Or how the cover looks? What kind of elements would need to be included in the perfect book for girls? And for boys? Your thoughts on this subject please!<br /><br />Trust the tide!<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, how's everyone doing?<br /><br />Thanks for another great crop of postings this week. Very interesting to hear your comments about boys books vs girls books. This obviously struck a chord with you lot!<br /><br />Can you tell I'm smiling? No? Well I am! I've had some really positive feedback to 'Blood Captain'. A big thumbs up from my agent and editor, added to which a buyer from one of the school book clubs read it and said it was the best 'Vampirates' so far. Hooray!<br /><br />I had a long meeting with my editor Venetia on Friday last week and we went through the edits she'd like me to make. There isn't much time to do them - to get the book in the shops for September, it needs to get to the printers by the beginning of July. As you may remember, as well as my editor Venetia, there's another person involved in this part of the proceedings - the copy editor, Jane. Venetia is concerned with all the changes to the book - both the overall shape of it and the itty bitty detail. Jane is more specifically focused on the detail. So ...<br /><br />I'll now tweak the various parts of the book which Venetia has highlighted. She'll then have another read before passing it to Jane to do the copy edit. Because time is short, we're all working flat out on this. When I told you before that writing a book was team work, this is what I meant!<br /><br />Rather excitingly, this week my publishers are throwing a party to celebrate 'Demons of the Ocean' selling 100, 000 copies in the UK. I'm going to have to write a speech, choose an extract from 'Blood Captain' to read and - most importantly - buy something cool to wear! I'm off to get that sorted, but before I go, here are some answers to your posts ...<br /><br />your book are good<br />KIERON, hi! Thanks for your nice feedback!<br /><br />Dear Justin, 
 sign me up for Grace and Cheng Li auditions too! lol. First, my questions to you, have you ever written any other story besides Vampirates? Was that your very first idea for a book when you decided to become an author? What did you do for a living before you wrote Vampirates? Also, have you been asked by some one in the movie business to turn your novel into a movie? Good idea about the quote from Vincent van Gogh! For dance, to keep myself from caving in from all the practising for examens, I usually look at pictures of famous dancers, or watch the Nutcracker and say, "I'll be as good as them some day". I worked on my story the other day, (after I wrote to you in my last comment) I think it's coming along well =). 
w for your question, hmmmmmm I think that most books are good for both boys and girls. But most children's novels seem to be geared to either just boys or just girls. I think Vampirates is a book both boys and GIRLS could really enjoy (I'm a girl, so I know). Not just boys are interested in vampires and pirates. For example, Pirates of the Caribbean, I think mostly girls like that movie even though it seems like a movie for boys. For girl books I think it's different, most books that are geared towards girls are about sleepovers, friends, and BOYS. I highly doubt that a boy would want to hear about that. As for boy books, that's a hard question because I'm not a boy =) but I think that they're not as gender sided. Yes, the cover also does show gender sides. For example, if there was a pink bunny on the cover who would read it? GIRLS. If there was a monster truck on the cover who would probably read it? BOYS. I think it's different when you're young because you usually don't like things that are different. For example, when a girl is young she'll read about fluffy animals, but as she gets older she progresses to murder mysteries and vampires? see what I mean? I think once you get to the age of 10, most books that are read are read by both boys and girls. To me it seems boys and girls become more open minded and into trying new things at an age in time (maybe in their teens) where they're experimenting with who they are and what they really like. Thanks for listening!
S. what do you think? Do you think it was right that they put your book on the boys list?<br />DANIELLE, great to hear from you, as always. I was interested to hear your thoughts on boys vs girls reading. You asked if I was happy to have my book on the list for boys. The answer is definitely yes, but I know that both girls and boys enjoy 'Vampirates' and long may that continue! I think I've answered some of your other questions in earlier blogs so scroll down and see if you can find the answers! I like your technique for keeping your confidence going ahead of dance exams. Nice one!<br /><br />Hi, 

ave recently discovered I really enjoy creative writing. I have loads of ideas for novels I would like to create but I am lost at where to start, like should I write a description of my main characters and plan it, as I was taught to do in school or should I just start writing? There are so many ideas I am finding it hard to get them all clear in my mind. If you could give me any pointers/advice I would be eternally grateful!<br />Thanks!<br />FAYE, hello! You were asking about taking your writing ideas a step further. I think you can progress in EITHER or BOTH directions. Get yourself a notebook and jot down character descriptions and ideas for the story arc etc - anything that's in your head about this story. It doesn't have to come out in an organised way at all. But the more you put down in the book, I think you'll find you're just ready to get going on the writing. Alternatively, do it the other way around and just start writing and see where it goes. Good luck! Let us know how you get on!<br /><br />Hello, first I have to apologise 4 my poor spelling in my last blog!!
st night I had a brainstorm for an excellent idea for a story. When I got stuck of what the plot should be I tock some of your advise and took a long walk with my dog. it was ve5ry relaxing and by the time I came back home I had the basic plot of the story. The story is called Prince of the Pirates and set in another world but that's all that I'm saying at the mo!;-)
hink if books have main characters that are both the gender I think it is both boy and girl book, so is yours. But I'm a girl and I love boy books like Alex Ryder 4 example.
t I guess some people like different things!i was reading tide of terror last night and I spotted some mistakes. On page 69 you spelt Lorcan as lovcan!! And there's this sentence when you write, Bart said. And he put his hand on Bart's shoulder which I think its suppose to be Connor's shoulder!! But don't worry, they're only minor mistakes:-)
hanx again for commenting to my comments and I have to say how much I get excited to see your comments!!
osyn!!!<br />RHOSYN, hi, I very much like the sound of Prince of the Pirates! Thanks (I think!) for pointing out those little mistakes in 'Tide of Terror'. You obviously are a very thorough reader! Let's hope there won't be too many gaffs in 'Blood Captain'.<br /><br />Hello again!!!!!!!!<br />Thanks so much for answering my question, it has really helped. I took the negative feedback and used it to develop my story. :D 
so on the topic about girls and boys books: I'm a girl and I love your books but other girls, my friends, like romantic books instead. I feel like I can read supposed "boy" and I really enjoy them! When I told my friend (who loves romance novels) this she was really surprised and I lent her one of my favourite books and practically after one page she chucked it back to me. I also borrow a lot of books from my brother. Some books though I do feel are too boyish, you know the ones with all the guns and blood. I'm just a bit too squeamish for those ones. :P
ay keep writing like YOU do and you'll get both boys and girls, unless the girl is like my friend, reading Vampirates. 
e question though (again, I know): How do you finish the book! I can never write endings! I write the beginning, introducing the characters through events, and then the middle, main events, but the climax?? BOOM! No climax. Do you have any tips for a desperate writer???<br />Keep on writing no matter what and good luck!!<br />Lollipop<br />LOLLIPOP, hello again! Glad to hear you're back on track with your story. You asked about endings. You're right - it can be tricky coming up with a good ending. I find this a particular challenge as I've got to end each book but keep the sequence as a whole going. I reckon the best advice is to think hard at the outset about where the story is going to end. You might not know the exact climax at this point but just knowing broadly where the characters will be and what they will have gone through is useful. I wrote the end chapters of 'Blood Captain' before writing some of the middle chapters. This was helpful too because I knew what I was building towards and could then sow seeds in that middle section.<br /><br />I'm having serious problems posting comments, here. I have a bit of a backlog of replies - I wrote them down so I could say them when I can post. :)<br />So firstly:
anks for the advice about the dialogue! I've never really thought about giving characters their own little sayings, but I'll try to use the idea now. :)
 you find the first chapter of a story hard to write? I sometimes do. What do you do if you are stuck?
as really sad about the Cutty Sark, too. I've visited it before and my sister scrubbed the decks, but I was too young to go on board! I think it's terrible that someone actually wanted that to happen (the police, etc. think it was deliberate) because it's such an amazing piece of history!<br />Also, yay that you can stay blogging! :D And well done on coming to the end of your book. I'm beginning to wonder if I'll ever get beyond the beginning of my current one! I'm having a bit of a problem there, really. I can't seem to make much headway at all with my story, and I'm wondering if anyone would want to read it anyway! What do you do in a situation like this?<br />Also, I was writing a story before but gave it up because, looking back on it, I though it was a bit... I dunno, predictable. But now I'm wondering what to do - whether to forget about it, or try again. What would you do?<br />I like seeing books as movies, as long as the creators do it well. For example, I think Lord of the Rings has been perfectly transferred from paper to screen... And Harry Potter has been done really well too. As someone who has read Harry Potter so
ny times my books are falling apart, I often think 'Oh, they didn't put that bit in, I wish they had' although of course there is not time to put everything in onto a movie! I think that, overall, books are very well changed into films.
m still trying to get my hands on a full set of your books, but from what everyone's saying I'm sure they'd make good films!<br />In response to your latest blog... I find that people are generally quite supportive and kind with feedback, although sometimes that's not what's best - if you show a piece of writing to a friend or family member, they are unlikely to speak their mind and just say 'it's good' to avoid offending you.<br />It's strange, but I find I have brainwaves whilst I'm lying in bed at night, about to fall asleep! Lately, I've had to start having a notepad and pen next to my bed to write all my ideas down!<br />On the topic of boy/girl books - I personally find I prefer books that are probably aimed at boys. I find that books for girls are a bit... well, I don't know how to describe it, but I only read them when I can't be bothered to find anything else, or I just want a bit of humorous reading. I find that books by authors like Anthony Horowitz and Garth Nix are more to my taste. I also like books with battles in (like Lord of the Rings) which are more aimed at boys. I think that often the cover would affect whether people buy books because it is the first impression of the book. For example, I doubt many boys would buy a bright pink book - it's obviously aimed at girls. I don't really know about colours for boys' books - they're pretty much any colour (except pink!). 
d say for girly books, there's got to be stuff about boys, growing up, that kind of thing. I have to say, it doesn't appeal to me though! ^_^ Not much of a real plot is needed..
 boys' books, there's usually lots of adventure, some kind of quest/mission, a really strong plot, often at least one major fight, that kind of thing. Although it's not just boys who read that kind of book!<br />Really long post today, so sorry about that! But like I said, it's because most of the time I can't post. :(
e for now!<br />RACHEL, hello and sorry you've had trouble posting. Thanks for all your comments! Now don't get defeatist about your own writing. And don't worry for now about who would want to read it. The first person you need to entertain as a writer is yourself! So write something that keeps your interest and excitement and you won't go far wrong. Don't pressurise yourself! If you want to have another stab now at that story, then do. Equally, if you feel like writing something fresh, that's cool too. Just have FUN with it!<br /><br />How do you get such good ideas for books? I love all of them!<br />GRACIE, hello and thank you very much! I'm glad you're enjoying my books. It's very difficult to pin down where ideas come from. These days, it's as if I live in two worlds - 1) the real world and 2) the world of 'Vampirates'. Having written three and a half (!) books in the sequence, I'm getting to know that world better and better and I love thinking up new characters or settings to work into it.<br /><br />I AM COMPLETLY AND TOTALY OBSESSED WITH YOU BOOKS I GOT TIDE OF TERROR YESTERDAY(JUNE 7) AND I'VE READ IT NONSTOP (EXCEPT TO EAT LOL)
AS WONDERING IF...
HERE'S GOING TO BE A 4TH BOOK?
F THERE GOING TO BE A MOVIE?
S THERE ANY WAY TO GET YOUR BOOKS PUBLISHED FASTER TO THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH IT'S COMING OUT SOON IN THE UK IT PROBALLY WON'T COME OUT TILL WINTER, OR LONGER, OVER HERE IN THE STATES?<br />more Q's 
ter finishing the 2nd book I had tons of questions pop into my head<br />1 What is up w/ all of Connors new friends names starting w/ J's<br />2 Did you take sword fighting lessons to help you when writing the book?<br />3 Which character are you most like?<br />4 Have you though of a name for the Captain and if so when are you going to tell us in the books?<br />5 Is Grace and Connors mother really dead? I know it says she died giving birth but I still can't help but think there's some connection between the Vampirates and their mom.<br />RIN, hello and welcome! There IS going to be a fourth book. Depending on how you look at it, that's 'Blood Captain' or the one after that if you don't count 'Dead Deep'! There's no movie deal as yet, but we'll see. 'Blood Captain' will be out in the US about this time next year. I'll pass on your comments to my US publisher, Little Brown!!! In answer to some of your other questions, I DID have a couple of sword-fighting lessons to help me when writing the book, but I'm keen to do more. Which character am I most like? There are - scarily - aspects of me in all of them!<br /><br />Do you like writing or does it sometimes get boring and do you ever get hand ake.<br />STRAWBERRY, hello! I do very much like writing. It hardly ever gets boring. In fact, I can't remember thinking it was boring at all. My hand doesn't ache too much because I type rather than write. The last time I got hand-ache was when I signed books for three hours in one day during a visit to Portsmouth last year.<br /><br />MYSTI, hello and thanks for your post. Glad you're enjoying the blog! I've got about three more weeks blogging on this site, then in mid-August I'll start a regular blog linked to the 'Vampirates' website. Would you enjoy my books? Well, all I can say is that whilst I think the main age-group I write for is 10-14, I have had some nice feedback from older kids and adults too. You also asked about how to avoid "running out of steam" when writing stories. I think that doing a bit more planning is the key to this. It's very easy in the course of writing a long narrative to find yourself going "off route". Sometimes it works well but other times it brings you to a dead end. In that case, having a "map" of the full story you want to tell will help you get back on track. You're not dependent on following the linear story then, so if something is causing you grief, you can jump to another bit and get stuck in there. Try it and let me know how you get on!<br /><br />Right, I'm off to find a groovy shirt. Have a great week, all of you, and do keep sending in your questions and comments...<br /><br />Oh and I have another question for you ... Which character from fiction would you like to meet for real? Imagine if they could step out from the pages of a book and spend time with you, your family and your mates. Who would it be? Indeed, those of you who are budding authors, it might be fun to have a stab at writing your own story about this.<br /><br />Trust the tide!
<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, how are you all?<br /><br />I mentioned last week that the guys at my UK publisher decided to throw a party to celebrate sales of the 'Vampirates' books and to "reveal" 'Blood Captain' to the world at large. Well, the party took place last Tuesday in a very cool club in central London. And I think a very merry time was had by all. It was great to see so many people who have helped make 'Vampirates' such a success and to be able to thank them in person.<br /><br />I had my family there as VIP guests. Unfortunately, the strap came off one of my sister's dresses but - guess what? - I saved the day by loaning her my Blue Peter badge to re-attach it. Who needs safety pins?! There really are 1001 different uses for a Blue Peter badge!<br /><br />You remember that last time I asked you all which fictional character you'd like to meet for real? Well, lots of you had some intriguing ideas about that and a couple of you asked me which of MY characters I'd enjoy meeting. Guess what? I DID meet one of my characters at the party because my publisher had hired an actress to play Ma Kettle for the evening. She welcomed everyone in to the party. She did a brilliant job and it was great coming face to face with my own character. As you can see from the above picture, we shared a good old giggle!<br /><br />At the party, I read a chapter from 'Blood Captain', which seemed to go down pretty well with the audience. It was exciting to read from the new book.<br /><br />It was back to business with the edits on Wednesday morning and I'm still hard at it. Almost there! I'm getting more and more excited about the book. I really can't wait for you guys to get your hands on it.<br /><br />I was excited to find out this week that Michael Rosen has been chosen as the new Children's Laureate. I'm a huge fan of Michael, especially his poetry. I don't think he'll mind me saying this, but I've been reading his stuff since I was a kid. So congratulations and good luck to Michael!<br /><br />Now then, here are some answers to your posts ...<br /><br />In response to your question about the character you'd like to meet; having thought about it I would have to be a bit clich&eacute; and say Albus Dumbledore! Someone with that amount of knowledge of the wizarding world, someone so intelligent and yet so witty; an excellent person to meet I would say.
t there are so many - I would love to have a long chat with Anne from Persuasion, she is such an interesting character, and also a girl called Kitty from the Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud. You might not know it, but I found this Kitty such a fascinating character - having been held prisoner with threats of death she escaped as her captor was attacked and about to be killed, and instead of running away she stopped and destroyed the thing trying to kill her enemy, simply because no one else was going to save him. Remarkable, in most books the captor would have died and she would have got away but it was such a pleasant and refreshing twist. And she is interesting in many other ways, but as my message already seems rather extensive I shan't go into it. I think I'll take your suggestion into account and write a story involving her, its an interesting task...<br />THE WHITE TREE, hello! Some interesting thoughts from you on fictional characters you'd like to meet for real. Good to hear you're a fan of Jonathan Stroud. I think he's a great writer and, what's more, we went to the same school though we didn't know each other very well then!<br /><br />Defiantly Grace :] She's my favourite character of them all and I love her personality and am sure it would so fun to play! But It might need to be played by twins because of Connor right? AND I'm the same age as Grace which helps! Though by the time [if you did a film] I would be older :( But do the film! Do the film!<br />Ooh and I wrote to someone (can't quite remember who...) about getting a signed book for my school auction and she was really kind! I really wasn't expecting a reply! And about a week ago my head teacher told me it had come! Very quickly too! I'll let you know how it gets on at the auction, thank you very much!<br />Question, if you HAD to choose one of your characters, as your favourite - who would it be? <br />EMZ, nice to hear from you again. I'm getting the impression you're keen for a 'Vampirates' film! Good luck with the auction! I can't really have a favourite amongst my own characters - that's too hard! Though I guess it would be fun to meet Ma Kettle and have a drink in her tavern. Come to think of it, I sort of did that already, didn't I?!<br /><br />Thanx for saying my idea seemed very interesting and I'm glad Demons of the Ocean has sold 100, 000 copies, congratulation(is that how you spell it?)
yhow it would be interesting to meet your enigmatic Captain, and I'd ask him lots of questions about him coz he is such a mystery! Also I'd love to meet Nancy off a book called Pirates by Celia Rees!
on't think you got my other blog, the one before last? well, I had an interesting question for you. 
 Sidorio survives the fire then can he survive out in light? And he has strange powers like the Vampirate Captain and so is he becoming like the Captain?
ll, I have to go now, 
e<br />RHOSYN, hey! I bet you WOULD ask the Vampirate Captain LOTS of questions! LOL. As to Sidorio, well I don't think we yet know IF he did survive the fire in 'Tide of Terror', do we? But certainly, I think it's safe to say that the Captain and the other Vampirates underestimated the range of Sidorio's powers. He's a bit of an unknown quantity.<br /><br />Thanks for all your advice and feedback. I am finally finding different ways to jot down all my ideas, for example, like with your excellent notebook idea! :D I am also managing to concentrate more on what I am doing - what I mean is, say if I am writing my thoughts down, I am able to concentrate on what I am doing right at that moment and then proceed further once I have finished. I think before I was thinking too fast (haha - can you do that? :p) and now I have managed to discipline my thoughts, and tame them.<br />Could I ask you, how can I get a poem I have written published? I don't want any of the money it receives and would rather give all the proceeds it makes to the charity I would like to promote through it. I have written lots of poems for a couple of months now but this one I just wrote today and it really sticks out. It flows really really well and just strikes a chord. If you could give me any advice I would be utterly grateful.<br />Thanks again for all your really amazing advice. I shall really miss you posting here as the Blue Peter Star Author When I finish my novel or get my first piece of work published I would love to let you know and thank you for all your help.<br />I also want to say congratulations on your recent success!<br />Thanks again (again!) :p<br />FAYE, hello again! Sounds like you're making great progress with your writing technique and focus. Well done! You asked about how to get a poem published and make some money for charity from it. Hmm. It's a nice idea but I'm not sure how you can make money from a single poem. You could always see if there are any poetry competitions you could enter or any poetry sites on the web, but I suspect that they won't pay much if anything. You could also bind up a few of your poems and sell the booklet to friends, family and neighbours in aid of your charity. If you like you could post your poem as a comment on my blog this week. Again that would be for free, but I'm sure other bloggers would enjoy reading it. Thanks for all your nice comments!<br /><br />I'd like to meet... Either Aragorn or Legolas. Aragorn because he's really amazing - he's... well, he's just awesome! He could teach me how to do sword-fighting! I'd also like to meet Legolas because he is a nice guy, and a great archer.
d also kinda like to meet Harry Potter. I've been thinking a lot, recently, about how if the stories were real and I got transported into them, I'd like to warn Harry about what he shouldn't do, to save him from all the stuff he regrets.
ird, I know, but there you go. I think I've been re-reading Harry Potter too much! I've read the 4th one so much the cover's nearly fallen off.<br />RACHEL, hello again! I need to know more about sword-fighting too so perhaps we should both meet Aragorn!<br /><br />Hi! :D 
m glad you're getting on well with your book! I'm squirming (literally) with excitement as I can't waiting for Blood Captain to come out! 
ve run out of questions for you! What's happening? Well I've had a lot going on so I couldn't think of any boogling questions to ask. 
t you've asked us a question so I'll answer that instead. The character I would most like to met? That's hard, very hard. There is two that leap out at me. 1. Bartimaues from The Bartimaeus Trilogy, I really loved those three books and a lot of the times I actually remember imagining that I was talking to him. Hehehe! 2. I would love to met the characters from my own stories! Then I could ask them questions so I knew even more things about them, wouldn't you? 
 I've found my question for you! Wouldn't you like to met one of your characters, what would you ask him/her/it?? 
od luck and never stop writing, no matter what!<br />LOLLIPOP, howdy! If you're running out of questions, then it's definitely time for me to wind up this blog! LOL. I like your idea of meeting characters from your own stories. Good one! As to meeting one of my own characters, I guess I've already answered that - see above! And good luck with YOUR writing.<br /><br />Dear Justin, 
estions for you (hopefully I haven't asked any of them yet) How long does it usually take to go over and fix everything with your editor? Also, what kind of genres do you like in books? What other themes do you like besides pirates and vampires?
out your question, (that's a hard one) it would probably have to be Lorcan from your books. I would want to meet him because his life would be interesting since he's been walking the earth for hundreds of years and had many experiences. I would want to know how his life is when he is not able to go in the sunlight or the only thing he can live on is other peoples blood. Other then Lorcan, I would want to meet Harry Potter. I would want to know what it's like to do magic and go to a school like Hogwarts. Ever since the very first movie came out it seems that up to the second or third movie my life has been a pretend Harry Potter movie between me and my cousins. It would be exciting to finally meet him. Well, out of comments and questions so don't forget to reply! =)<br />DANIELLE, hello again! How long does it take to go over and fix everything with my editor? Well, with 'Blood Captain', it's taking us about a month. This is pretty fast but we needed to be fast to keep to the publishing schedule. Two to three months is probably more usual and more ideal, as it gives both sides more thinking time. On the other hand, working at speed can be quite invigorating so I've no complaints. What kinds of genres/themes do I like in books? To be honest, I try to read as widely as possible because a) I enjoy finding a book to suit my mood and b) I think it's great to be exposed to a really wide range of writing. That said, I do love a cracking thriller where you cannot bear to put the book down! I'm filing away a few of those for my upcoming holiday.<br /><br />Dear Justin, 
 answer to your question I would like to meet Cheng li or Grace because they seem really interesting! I was jut wondering how long does it take you to write a book without it getting edited or anything just to write it? I'm really looking forward to reading Blood Captain! Congratulations on selling 100, 000 copies of Demons of the ocean! And also when did you write your first novel? <br />GRACIE, hello! I'm sure Grace and Cheng Li would be keen to meet you too, even if it got confusing having two Graces around! It takes about six months to write my books, excluding the editorial process. I wrote my first book in 1991. It was a "Puzzle Adventure" called 'The Pyramid Plot'. But 'Demons of the Ocean' (2005) was my first proper novel.<br /><br />I read both your books at school and when one of m friends saw me reading it they got it out of the library as well and loved it!<br />MALI, hello and welcome! Thanks very much for your nice feedback on the books. I hope you and your mates continue to enjoy them.<br /><br />Hey Justin. Glad that the edit of BLOOD CAPTAIN is going well. I cannot wait to read it. Its gonna be awesome! And congrats that DEMONS OF THE OCEAN has sold 100, 000 copies. That's awesome and it needs to be celebrated!!!!!!!<br />Anywhoo... If I could meet anyone from fiction... Mmmm... Well there are a few actually.<br />1) Matt from The Power of Five books by Anthony Horowitz. He seems so cool especially after he gets over his rebellious phase. Also, Id like to beg him to save the world from The Old Ones. Lol.<br />2) The Vampirate Captain. He is AMAZING! I love the concept of him and his mysteriousness. I wish I could create a character like him for my books but I would probably have to resolve to copying and I wouldn't do that as obviously you have put a lot of work into him. I would ask him lots of questions as he has such knowledge and wisdom so would have the answers. As long as he didn't want to drink my blood, I'd be okay.<br />3) Connor. He seems like the sort of person I am friends with. Very cool, honest and frankly, a lads lad if you know what I mean. Plus, I like the fact that he is a teenager and has adapted to life aboard The Diablo so swiftly and with no fuss at all.<br />Who would you like to meet from fiction?<br />Also, only 2, maybe 3 questions.<br />1) In your last blog (the one I am now commenting on) you said you had written 3 and a half books about The Vampirates world. Is this half-a-book DEAD DEEP or part of Book Four maybe?<br />2) When you get the total number of pages for BC, can you please post it here? I want to know how many pages I have to savour.<br />Hey, only 2! Yeah! Anyway, I gotta go now so talk again soon!<br />Bye!<br />RYAN, great to hear from you as always! In answer to your questions... when I said "and a half" I WAS referring to 'Dead Deep'. I haven't yet started on Book Four (give me a chance!) although I am full of ideas for it. And we've taken one key chapter out of 'Blood Captain', which will now go into the next book. I hope to know how long 'Blood Captain' is by the time of my last blog here so I will endeavour to tell you. But I will tell you this now - it is looking like it is a fair bit longer than 'Tide of Terror'. You may need to do some arm exercises before attempting to lift it!!!<br /><br />That's about all for this week! Please do keep sending in your questions and comments ...<br /><br />I have another question for you... I'm interested to know how you guys find out about new books and what makes you want to get your hands on them. Do you make regular visits to bookshops and/or libraries? Do you rely on recommendations from mates or teachers? Or do you hunt out reviews in magazines, newspapers and online? Look forward to hearing your thoughts!<br /><br />Trust the tide!
<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, how are you all?<br /><br />Well, the new book is halfway through the copy edit stage so we're verrrry close now. By the end of this week, it should all be done and be winging its way to the typesetters. This is a time of mixed emotions. There's a great feeling of satisfaction of finishing and excitement that it is nearing the publication stage. But it's also a little sad to let go of it.<br /><br />Talking of sad, next week marks my last (sob!) blog here on the Blue Peter site. It's been a great run - it will be 20 weeks next week. At the beginning, I wondered if I'd have enough to say but I seem to have, don't I?! And you lot have been brilliant, sending in all your thoughts, comments and questions. Oh, I'm getting all emotional but I'm going to pull myself together as we've got two more blogs together.<br /><br />With my workload lightening up a bit, I took some time out this week to visit old friends in the Peak District. We went on some long walks and, as we were hiking through a lovely Derbyshire village, I happened across evidence of pirates - as you can see from this week's pic. I hadn't expected to find them so far inland but it just goes to show that piracy is on the move and growing all the time!<br /><br />Looking back over the previous blogs, a lot of you are clearly budding writers. Some of you have joined the blog midway through and I thought it might be helpful for me to pull together some of the advice I've given you in my Ten Tip Top Tips for Budding Writers. So here, in no particular order &ndash; goes...:<br /><br />1. Have fun with your writing! Don't get too hung up on getting published RIGHT NOW. You have plenty of time for that later. You should use this time to experiment and develop as a writer.<br /><br />2. If you're having trouble "running out of steam" or are attempting some longer stories, try to draw up a plan. Keep referring to it as you go along, but feel free to change it too.<br /><br />3. Research adds an extra dimension to your writing. Even if you are writing fantasy, there's generally some useful research you can do into characters and locations. It's really worth taking the extra effort and it's a great excuse for travelling etc...<br /><br />4. Ideas come from all over the place and when you least expect them. Start carrying around a small notebook at all times - one that fits in your jacket is ideal. Then you'll never lose an idea!<br /><br />5. Feedback can really help boost your confidence as a writer so think about sharing your work with mates. Even better, get a "writing group" together so you can help each other with CONSTRUCTIVE criticism.<br /><br />6. Don't get brought down by "writer's block". There are loads of ways you can combat this from taking a break, to trying a different route into the story, to doing fresh research.<br /><br />7. Don't play safe with your writing. In fact, go wild! You might decide to pare back some of your wilder excesses but generally when you push the limits in your writing, you learn something.<br /><br />8. Giving characters interesting names is a really important part of the process. Keep your eyes and ears open for intriguing names and jot them down in your "ideas book".<br /><br />9. Read as much - and as widely - as you can. The more you read, the better you will write. And you'll have fun as you do. Even if you don't like a certain book, or don't think it's that well written, it can help you develop your own writing "voice".<br /><br />10. Don't give up! You might find your life gets so busy it's hard to continue writing. Or some negative comment or another might put you off. If you are really determined to become a writer, just keep on doing it and, chances are, you'll get there.<br /><br />I hope that's some useful food for thought. Now then, here are some answers to your posts...<br /><br />Hi Justin. I'm glad you had a great party. I wish I could have heard the chapter from BLOOD CAPTAIN. All those people there were really lucky.
d now knowing that a key chapter has been pushed back to Book Four is awesome Now we will have to ponder what was in it... Hmmm...<br />Anyway. I find out about new books in several ways.<br />1) I am very loyal to authors I have already read. For example, when Raven's Gate by Anthony Horowitz came out, I instantly wanted to read it as I had already read the Alex Rider books. I daresay it will be the same with any other series you write! :)<br />2) The internet. I search and look for reviews as well as excerpts<br />3) TV. Its how I came to read Vampirates. I saw you on Blue Peter talking about DEMONS OF THE OCEAN and thought, why not give it a go? I'm glad I did!<br />And finally 4) Word of mouth. A few of my friends read (only 2 actually out of 10!) and we talk about different books and stuff. One also writes like me so we show each other our writing which is fun.<br />Good luck with the rest of editing Justin. I cannot wait to get my hands on it and if its bigger than TIDE OF TERROR, I will need to clear space on my bookshelf! Lol.<br />Talk again soon, <br />RYAN, hey! Thanks for your thoughts on the subject of how you find out about new books. I'm very glad I appeared on Blue Peter if that's what introduced you to Vampirates in the first place. I hope you've cleared that space on your bookshelf. Ahead of the final copy edit, the new book is up to 120, 000 words (the previous one was about 95, 000 so that's like 25% more story!)<br /><br />Hi again! 
 answer to your new question My mum works with books and she has lots of proof copies so I read those or I go on the internet at home and they usually have new books on their. How did you get your first book published?<br />GRACIE, nice to hear from you again! That's cool that you get to read proof copies. For those of you who don't know what "proofs" are, these are bound up versions of the text that publishers send out to reviewers and booksellers ahead of the finished book. In answer to your question, I first got published simply by answering an advert for a writer/editor. I had to do a sample spread from a story and, on the strength of that, was commissioned to write my first book.<br /><br />Heheh! Great use of your Blue Peter badge! Hahaha!
ve decided to continue my old story. I read through it again and decided I liked the style I wrote it in, and though I am now going through changing great chunks of it, and adding in new ideas, I'm sticking with the basic plot.
now I'm nowhere near the stage yet, but how do you think a child/teen could go about getting an agent, to get their book published? You said before that it's a lot easier to get an agent. 
though, that said, I have looked at publishers who's books I like, and they seem to welcome first-time authors - even those without agents. Are there many publishers who do this, do you think?<br />I generally hear of new books from my mum (who buys me books she knows/thinks I'll like!), or continued series books that I know are coming - like The Keys to the Kingdom series, and - obviously - HARRY POTTER!!!!! I really can't WAIT 'till the 21st July!!!!!!!!! :D:D
e you a fan of Harry Potter?<br />Well, that's all from me right now! Bye!<br />RACHEL, hello again! It was a good use of my Blue Peter badge but I must make sure now to get it back from my sister! I'm really pleased you've gone back to work some more on your story. Keep at it! As far as getting an agent goes, if you write something sufficiently arresting, you have as much chance as anyone of getting an agent (and a publisher) to take interest in your work. Possibly more so. But please don't get too hung up on the idea of publishing your work just yet. It isn't the "be all and end all".<br /><br />Hi Justin!! I finally found out that you were blogging here , although a tad late! Just to say I love your books more than all the others I have read (sorry other books!).<br />Anyways , since I'm here rambling on I thought I could help with your question. Generally I wander about book shops once or twice a week after school and randomly pick up books from the shelves. If the books blurb is good I'll take it. It's kind of like a game of chance , on one hand you could be picking up the best book you've ever read , on the other hand not picking up a book that's suited to you. But I mostly get it right.<br />I just realised how much I'm babbling on so I'll go now. Bye!<br />QUARXPHONIX, hi and welcome. Don't worry about coming late-ish to this blog. From mid-August, I'll be blogging through the official Vampirates site so you must come and check me out there. Wow, you are a very frequent visitor to bookshops. Me too! I must say I find it really hard to go into a bookshop and come out without buying something.<br /><br />Ahoy-hoy!
m glad you're getting on well with Blood Captain. I hope you enjoyed yourself. Sounds fun! F-U-N :D I've recently found out that writing stories might not be my main thing! Writing poems actually might, anything inspires me to write a poem Dark clouds to white flowers under a bush. Maybe when I'm older I'll have a longer attention span and be able to write a novel, which is my dream. LOL. Have you ever written any poems is my question? Pretty easy, mainly yes or no answer. ;) Anyway to your question. How I get new books? Well I'm pretty rubbish at finding books myself! Hehehehehehe. I mean I didn't see Vampirates, my dad saw it, it was probably because I was too busy looking in the girl's section at this time! Well I'm ok at picking books out, shiny covers do attract my eyes though. Also about the friend referring thing, I must say that I am further ahead in my reading than most of my friends so they can't really refer books for me and the ones who can are more of the romantic book types. How were you at picking out books when you were younger?

od luck and never stop writing no matter what!<br />LOLLIPOP, ahoy oh poetic one! I think poetry is really tricky - perhaps in some ways more than stories or novels, as you really have to make every word count. And not just the meanings of the words, but the sounds and rhythms and associations. I guess this is true for any writing but it is all the more true for poetry. I haven't written much poetry per se, but I do enjoy writing the "songs" and poems that crop up from time to time in my books. I'm especially pleased with the Vampirate shanty and with the Pirate's Prayer that is read at Jez's funeral in Tide of Terror.<br /><br />Hi 
st wondering
 you have origins of your characters?<br />REZ, hello! You asked if I had "origins" of my characters. I'm not sure I know exactly what you are asking. I think you may be asking if I've been inspired by any real-life people. The answer is definitely yes. Cheng Li is based on a famous Chinese pirate called Cheng I Sao. In the new book, I have some fun with this as Cheng Li tells Connor about Cheng I Sao and what an inspiration she found her. Other characters have some connection to real-life characters but generally they are a blend of different influences rather than having one single origin.<br /><br />I am very lucky as my Mum works at my local library. I often go there to look for new books, but mostly my Mum knows about all the new books and has very good recommendations for me. I also look for new books by authors I already like and enjoy browsing round bookshops and amazon.co.uk.<br />I very rarely buy books new as I usually wait for them to come into the library and then borrow them. I also pick some good quality books up for cheap prices from second hand shops. However, occasionally I do buy brand new books if I cannot wait for them to come to the library.<br />I was surprised to read about your first published book, as when I was younger I was a huge fan of the Usborne Puzzle Adventure Books. I have read 'The Pyramid Plot and I would highly recommend it!<br />Thanks for your advice on planning stories.<br />Best wishes, 
sti<br />MYSTI, hi again! Sounds like you - like Gracie - have an inside track on new writing through your mum. Nice one! Thanks for your thumbs up for The Pyramid Plot. It was fun to do but I enjoyed writing the story MUCH more than thinking up the puzzles!!!<br /><br />I'm Glad you enjoyed your party:-P In fact I'm having my own party today as its MY BIRTHDAY! I'm finally 14!LOL. The only thing I want is Blood Captain but its not out yet so I have to wait a little longer. Also I find out about new books on the internet, TV or in book shops. Actually I first saw your First book on Blue Peter and I was very interested init. So I have a lot to thank Blue Peter! Yesterday I made my older sister read my vampire story, Which took long to persuade her 'cause she hates reading. But she didn't make me happy as she said it had a bit to much description writing and that it was to boring. That made me very sad. So what I want to know is do you ever hear bad reviews and how do you deal with them? So now I must improve my story and have a party!! 
ur biggest fan RHOSYNx<br />RHOSYN, hello! Belated birthday congrats! Hope the party went well. I answered a question about "bad reviews" a few weeks back. I think you have to pick wisely who you show your writing to. In this case, you say yourself that your older sis "hates reading"! So the fact that she thought your story had too much description might just be that she isn't used to or doesn't like books with description in them. Next time, show your work to a keen reader and see what they say. But try not to take it too personally!<br /><br />Dear Justin, 
unds like you had a very exciting time at the party. I wish I could have been there! Sounds like Blood Captain is very long, good! I absolutely can't wait until it comes out. I'm glad it's long because I usually I read your books in almost less then a month because I'm so into the story! Questions for you, do you think that when you get tired of writing Vampirates (hopefully never. lol) you will start another series of books? I wish I could ask something else, but I'm out of questions! If I think of anything else I will write back to you (it's hard to think I'm at my friends house and we have to eat dinner now) As for your question, I go to book stores, barns and noble and borders, as much as I can. I love walking around and finding new books that interest me. Other then that, if I hear good reviews from a friend about a book I'll usually go to the book store to check it out. Well, have to go now, so don't forget to comment back!<br />DANIELLE, hey again! You asked if I ever get tired of writing Vampirates, will I start another series of books? I'm sure the answer is yes. In fact, I might not wait until I'm "tired" of Vampirates. There's no reason why you can't develop two ideas at the same time. It's just a question of getting the next really good idea! In answer to your second question, yes I would love to be an author for the rest of my working days! I'm having so much fun with it and I think I have a long way to develop as a writer. Glad that Jen and your mum are enjoying the book!<br /><br />I love your books I am a Hugh fan of all of them so far anyway good luck and I hope you have fun<br />RIKA, hello and thanks for your posting!<br /><br />What books did you read when you were younger?
<br />MINK, hi! When I was younger, I read a lot of different kinds of books. Some of my favourites - in no particular order - were CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY by Roald Dahl, THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE by C S Lewis, THE SECRET GARDEN by F Hodgson Burnett, THE BOY NEXT DOOR by Enid Blyton, THE BAGTHOROPE SAGA books by Helen Cresswell and THE OUTSIDERS by S E Hinton.<br /><br />That's about all for this week! Please do send in your questions and comments for my last (sob!) blog next week.<br /><br />As it IS my last blog next time, I thought I'd ask you lot a question about endings. We had a question a week or so back about how to write a good ending. What do YOU look for in the end of a book? Do you like everything to end neatly with every loose end answered? Or do you like a more ambiguous ending or PERHAPS an out-and-out cliffhanger? Which books do you think have the best endings (try not to give the plot away for those of us who haven't read them yet!)? And do you like a generally happy ending or maybe one that brings a tear to your eye? I'm really looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.<br /><br />Trust the tide!
<br />Justin<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hi guys, how's everyone doing?<br /><br />Well, here it is! My last blog on the Blue Peter site. Twenty weeks ago, we started chatting and, I must say, time really has flown!<br /><br />This week, we finished copy edits on 'Blood Captain'. Last Friday, it went off to the typesetters. In about a week's time, I'll get a page proof of it. This will be loose pages but they will look just like the insides of a book. I'm really looking forward to this as it starts to feel much more like a real book at this point. When you read it, set out in typeset, it gives you a new feel for the story - almost as if you are reading it for the first time. I'll still have the chance to make small changes to it but then it will go off to be printed, in time to hit bookshops in September.<br /><br />With my work on the book done, I've been able to get out and about a bit more. Last week, I was lucky enough to be invited to the Blue Peter summer garden party. It was a bit of a damp night so we ended up not in the Blue Party garden itself but inside the studio itself. It was a great party and, as you can see from the pic, I met all the stars of the show!<br /><br />I'll be getting out and about even more when I return from my summer holiday. I'm going to be touring the UK to publicise my new book for much of October. Ahead of that, you can catch me at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in August and the Bath Festival of Children's Literature and the Windsor Festival in September. If you're anywhere in the vicinity of these, please do come along and say hello!<br /><br />A lot of you have asked for the address of my new blog. You'll be able to access this through the official Vampirates website. I'll be launching the blog when I get back from Australia in the second half of August so do look out for it then and come say hi! And, in answer to several of you, you WILL of course be able to leave your own posts there.<br /><br />Now then, here are some answers to your posts from this week ...<br /><br />Bonjour!<br />I'll be so sad to see you go. You have to start another blog, you said you were going to. In the next blog tell us the webiste address. 
ave one very *sniff* last *sniff* question for you. It's about handwriting, how exactly is your handwriting? My handwriting is not neat, when I get really stuck into writing my story is so illedgeable because I'm going so fast. (That's why I use the computer.) What about you?
anks for the Top Ten Writing Tips (nice bit of alliteration) they're so brilliant I copied and pasted them into Word. I especially like the notebook idea as names for characters is probably one of my weaks points, hehe. 
so you asked about endings. I like endings that I'm sad that's its ended and that I have to think a little about what happens next. I don't like cliffhangers as you just think the writer has lost their imagination. Basically I like a rounded off ending that makes me sad it's ended and also the ending isn't dragged out after the action. It should be cut right off, unless you do an epilogue The type of ending (happy, sad etc.) though is tricky, I don't mind if it makes me cry or smile or both.<br />Lollipop<br />Good luck, keep writing no matter what! (This means books and blogs, lol!)<br />LOLLIPOP, hello again! You asked about my handwriting. The answer is that it is italic and super-neat when I write a small amount, like on a postcard say. But if I write anything longer - or faster! - it gets really messy. This is one of the reasons I prefer to write my books straight onto the computer screen. Thanks for your thoughts on endings!<br /><br />After the book is published, you should DEFINATLY look into it. Just make sure you hold open auditions for the part of Grace! And that people aged 14/15 can enter :D Can authors ask for their books to be come into film? Or do they have to wait until they are asked? I'd love if you'd be able to explain more in your next blog!<br />Oh no! You can't leave! Will there be a new author to replace you? And what will all of Vampirates-fans with zillions of questions for you do? It is rare that an author will ACTUALLY respond to a question/comment in letter or email!<br />As for your questions on endings, it depends what sort of book it is. If it is a series that continues, a cliffhanger is always amazing as it makes you REALLY want to read the next book and leaving loads of questions unanswered always gets us readers pondering. But I personally think there are FAR too many happy endings out there! Bring on the tear jerkers!<br />EMZ, you asked about movies - again! The situation with movies is that your agent can pitch to movie companies or indeed the movie companies can pitch to you. The situation with Vampirates is that several people have expressed interest in turning the book(s) into a movie but there's no deal to be done just yet. As for your other 'zillions' of questions, you'll have to come and find my new blog later in August. I think that the Blue Peter team are planning on having a new Star Author here, so don't think so much of me leaving as morphing - Doctor Who style - into someone new! Since you like tear-jerker endings, I think you will be satisfied with 'Blood Captain' when it is published.<br /><br />OOH NOOO! I'll be sad to see you go but I'm happy to hear that you are doing a blog on your website:-p My B/D was great and I got a book called The Princess and the Captain which I highly recommend Vampirate readers! I've rewriting my story and I have to say its never been better, Its good when someone tells what is wrong about it because you know how to improve them. Also I'm taken your advise as well and I'm trying not to get too serious with it. It is mostly a hobby! 
 favourite kind of endings are when you discover a secret or perhaps a cliffhanger although sometimes they do get on my nerves because you have to wait for the next book to see what happens next! My favourite ending is the last book of the Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy series when Marvin, the depress robot, is finally happy but then dies! How annoying is that? Thank you for the info you've given me, write to you next week hopefully not the last time!!<br />RHOSYN, hello again! Glad you had a great birthday. I really like the sound of The Princess & The Captain - I shall be looking out for that. Also really pleased to hear you're getting on well with your own writing. Have fun with that over the summer. Thanks for your thoughts on endings. Great example you gave from 'Hitchiker's Guide'. I guess in character terms, having become happy, Marvin had no further 'journey' to make. That's a great example of an ending that seems sad in one respect but mostly absolutely right and appropriate. Much better to end a story and a character's involvement in it at the right moment than have them outstay their welcome.<br /><br />Don't go PLEASE!!!!!!!! Your blog is sooooooooooooooooooooo great! It is one of the best things on cbbc! (Oh no, maybe I shouldn't of said that!)I go on here every day wondering if you've done your blog! I'm going to be sad :( I really liked the Ten Top Tips! I guess the type of endings are sad ones. Because the ones I've come up with are pretty grim: 
s the the trees blow and the birds sing, I am now gone with the wind' Intending that the main character dies. And;
s the rotten teeth of the monster sank deep into his arm his last thoughts were...' 
hink I like grim endings because you could make up what happens next instead of 'they lived happily ever after' That is soooooooooooooo boring! I mean it's nice for little children but it gets boring after a while!
at was your job before you became a writer? Did you have any experience writing before? 
hink after the Ten Top Tips (Great tong twister!) I mat go back to the two stories I started! :) I hope your book sells well! (I'm sure it will!) I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really REALLY wish that you come back! I love this blog! 
st keep writing! Just keep writing! what do you do? You just keep writing! Just keep writing! Just keep writing! what do you do? You just keep writing! 
ug to the the 'Just keep swimming' Song sung by Dory in Finding Nemo)
erything Will go well!
acie
S. My spelling is rubbish so sorry if I spelt anything wrong!<br />GRACIE, hey! Thanks for all the nice things you've said on - and about - the blog. I like your grim endings!!! Before I was a writer, I was a publicist for other writers. I had to write a lot of things in that job, such as press releases, but really, to become a writer, the best experience is to just do it! So I hope you DO go back to the two stories you started. And do come and check out my new blog.<br /><br />Dear Justin, 
an't believe that your blogging on this website is coming to an end. I will miss going on the computer to see if you put on a new blog entry and if you wrote back to me yet. If you start another blog, or anything similar to that, please tell me on the next blog entry on Blue Peter. Anyway, as my mom was reading the first Vampirates (she is about in the middle of the book now) she noticed a few details I hadn't paid much attention to. I was talking to her last night and according to her the book never explained these things:
. The book never explains who the Tempest twins mother is. It just says that the father disappeared for a year or so and comes back with 2 twins. Also that she appears to Grace in a dream with green eyes.(correct me if I'm wrong)
. The father waved at a mysterious ship in the harbour while in the light house (my mom says it was the Vampirate ship but she isn't sure. My mom thinks that the father knows the ship)
. Connor sees a painting in Molucco's cabin that was stolen from the governors house that looks familiar to him. 
. When Connor goes on the pirate ship and tells the pirates his name they react as if it sounds familiar 
 mother thinks there's a connection between the Vampirates and the twins. She thinks it's strange that Connor, even when he doesn't go to practice, is excellent at sports. Also, that Grace unusual knowledge. I told my mom I wasn't sure because I've already read the second Vampirates and it doesn't really go back to any of those details, but there are still four more books. Are any of these details important to remember? Are you going to go back to them in later Vampirate books? 
 for your question, I like an ending that keeps you on the edge and wanting to read more, The only bad thing about these endings is if there isn't another book to continue. That's why I usually like books that are a series, so even if you finish the book, you look froward to the next one and hopefully your questions about it will be answered. As for happy or sad endings, that's a hard one, I like endings that will bring you in a good mood and make you glad you read the story not ones that will make you regret reading the book. To be shocked at the end of a book can be good or bad, it really depends. For example, one of the main characters dies (bad) or the main character meets the person they have been looking for in the whole book (good). Well, sorry that my entry is so long it's just that there's so much to say in one time. I really hope I can write to you again somewhere else! =)<br />DANIELLE, hi! Thanks for all your thoughtful contributions to the blog. I enjoyed hearing all the questions your mom had about 'Demons of the Ocean'. She's a canny reader, isn't she? Here are the answers to your questions:<br /><br />1. No, the books have not YET explained who the twins' mum was. Both Grace and Connor have emerald green eyes. Their dad doesn't so Grace reckons that her mum must have had the same eye-colour.
<br />2. Dexter Tempest does wave to the Nocturne when he sees it out in the bay. This does suggest he has some connection to the ship, doesn't it?<br />
3. The painting that Connor recognises is a famous painting of sunflowers by Van Gogh. Remember that Vampirates is set in the future so all kinds of familiar things might turn up in new places.
<br />4. I'm not sure that I agree with you here!
<br />5. Connor is naturally gifted at sport and Grace is naturally very bright.<br />I would say that it's worth bearing all of your mom's observations in mind. She's picked up on some key mysteries which underpin the plot and which you will find answers to if you keep reading!<br /><br />Hello again!
, no! Do you have to go?? And if you do we still have to wait until August to chat with you again! :(
t on a happier note, I have finally managed to get some Vampirates books! I've got Demons of the Ocean and Dead Deep. (Yes, I am sad to say I didn't have them before!) I'm now desperate to get Tide of Terror, and in my longing have already read Demons of the Ocean twice, the second time straight after finishing the first time! I also can't WAIT until Blood Captain is published now! Are you going to write more Vampirates books? I hope so! ;)
ould LOVE to act as Grace, if Vampirates is ever put into a film! Do you think it will be? And like Emz said in her comment on this blog, do you think there would be open auditions?
dings - I like ones that aren't really easy to predict. For example, I really liked Demons of the Ocean because the ending was keeping you guessing - for example (anyone reading, look away NOW if you've not read Demons of the Ocean yet!), I though a full scale attack was going to be waged when the two ships met, but in the end little fighting came about. And it was a nice way to end the book - a bit of a cliffhanger, since I instantly wanted to know what happened next to Grace and Connor, but the story is also rounded off.
m desperate to know the answers to the questions Demons of the Ocean raises. Who is the mysterious Vampirate captain? Why did Grace and Connor's father wave to a mysterious ship in the harbour? How did he die? Did he become a Vampirate? Is he in fact the Vampirate captain? Is the voice Connor hears his father or the Captain? I can't wait to get Tide of Terror now!
AT?! Jez dies?!?! :(<br />Well, good luck with getting Blood Captain published! :D<br />RACHEL, hi! I'm afraid you will have to wait until mid-August for my new blog as I'll be on my hols ahead of that with no web/e-mail access! I'm glad you have a bit of reading to keep you occupied in the interim! I certainly am going to write more Vampirates books. In fact, I'll be jotting down ideas for the next one as soon as I get back. In terms of movies and auditions, well - as I say - we'll just have to see! In answer to your other questions:<br /><br />1. You'll find out more about the Vampirate captain in 'Blood Captain'.<br />
2. See my answer to Danielle above!
<br />3. That's a bit of a mystery, isn't it?
<br />4. Is Dexter Tempest the Vampirate captain? No comment!
<br />5. The voice Connor hears is his dad's.<br />p.s. thanks for your second post. I'm thrilled you're enjoying Book Two so much. And my website too!

<br /><br />hi! pleeeeeeeeeeeeesse make Vampirates into a film! id love to play grace! and also have auditions in Scotland!<br />bye!<br />ERI, hello! As you're based in Scotland, perhaps I will see you at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in August?<br /><br />Wow - has it been 3 months already? I have just one... *sniffs and sobs* last... question for you. What is your favourite story genre? Mine is fantasy adventures!<br />MALI, hi! My favourite story genre? That's a tough one. I've been thinking it over and thinking about some of my favourite books and I'm going to say 'family stories'. The reason being that two of my absolute favourite books are 'Cloudstreet' by Tim Winton and 'The Hotel New Hampshire' by John Irving. When it comes to books for younger people, another of my favourites is Helen Cresswell's 'The Bagthorpe Saga'. I come from quite a large family myself (two sisters and a brother - the new book is dedicated to them) so I think perhaps that explains why I enjoy reading about other families! And writing about them too.<br /><br />Thanks for the tips Justin. I have found a nice little notebook and it now comes everywhere with me! I have already had some great ideas to record in it :)<br />When you start your new blog on the Vampirates' website, will readers still be able to comment on it? I really hope so.<br />I don't really mind what sort of ending a book has. I prefer it when they are not happy happy, as I find books like that a bit predictable sometimes. If they leave some ends lose, you have to be able to tell it is meant to be like that. Otherwise it just seems scruffy and creates the impression the author cannot be bothered to end the book properly. I also do not like endings where the characters situation does not seem to have changed from the start of the book. That makes me question the point of reading the book!<br />Have you ever met any famous authors? I haven't, but I do dream of meeting Jacqueline Wilson; I used to love her books :)<br />My Vampirates books that I ordered from the library have just arrived today, so now I am off now to start reading.<br />Good luck in your future.
 I become a children's writer, like I hope too, then we may meet sometime in the future :)
ve Mysti x<br />MYSTI, hello again! Very excited to hear about your notebook. I hope other blogees are following your lead. We'll all need ideas books to carry around over the summer months. I have met a fair few famous authors, including Jacqueline Wilson and Anthony Horowitz. It's great meeting other children's writers and comparing notes on writing etc. You can learn loads by listening to them. Good luck with your own writing!!!<br /><br />Hi! I've read both your Vampirates books (I'm waiting for my mom to order Dead Deep from Amazon for me at the moment =() multiple times. I read the first one not long after it came out then got Tide of Terror a couple of weeks ago ' annoyingly I had forgotten just about everything about Demons of the Ocean by the time I read it and I couldn't find my book ANYWHERE. So I just had to rack my brains to remember about things. I couldn't believe about Lorcan's sight, but when I re-read DOTO I remembered ' it all came flooding back so to say.<br />I keep skipping to my favourite bits of the books, haha, and reading, re-reading and reading again. My mom recently read both your books and thought they were great. I cant wait for Blood Captain!<br />As for endings; I find sad endings pretty good (when I watch movies with my dad and there's a sad ending we always end up crying together ' we're softies ' lol!)<br />I find endings that seem to be rushed annoying at the best ' or when they think 'Wait, we can't kill off this character! I know, we'll kill him/her off then she/he will miraculously spring back to life before the end!'.<br />I hardly ever cry over books when I read them ' when I read them out loud I sometimes do but rarely even if they do move me. I read one book recently about a poor boy who was separated from his mother for years and even when he found her they couldn't be together because of a vow she had made. That made me cry.<br />I like cliffhangers because I love discussing and wondering about what will happen. HOWEVER I hate cliffhangers at the end of a series. Or when you know there will be no more films. I hate that. I hate that a lot. (I better stop talking about this else you'll be spammed by me putting 'I hate that I hate that I hate that' etc. I'm like that '<br />A few weeks ago (before I found your blog =() you asked about movies. Something I dislike about movies, Harry Potter for example, is that when you read a book you have a mental image of each character ' I used to be able to see Sirius Black clearly in my minds eye. Ever since seeing the film I now only see Gary Oldman and that's sad. Half of me would love to see your books as a film ' the other half is scared of losing the image of Lorcan, Cheng Li and the captain in my mind.<br />I have a question about the wallpapers on vampirates.co.uk ' are they done with artwork or computer graphics? Are they modelled on people or just the imagination of who designed/drew them?<br />Wow, I've written a lot. Finally I would like to say I'm really glad you are going to be blogging on your site and you can expect to see me leave comments (if you have the ability to leave comments on there. <br />BASSAIR, howdy! I'm glad you and your mom have been enjoying the books. Thanks for all your insightful comments. I found your point about movies really interesting and I completely agree with you. As much as it would be lovely to have a movie of Vampirates, in a lot of ways it is nice not to so that we can all see the characters in our own way. The wallpapers on the website are computer-generated. These character images appear in the UK editions of the books (very different to the US jackets, though these too are computer-generated). They were modelled based on descriptions of the characters and then with some back and forth between me and Bob Lea, the illustrator.<br /><br />Well, that's about it guys. Thanks SO much for all your comments and questions over the past twenty weeks. It's been a real pleasure 'meeting' you all and chatting about reading, writing and the like. I'll miss you but hope to catch up with some of you through my new blog. Good luck with all your own writing and here's wishing each and every one of you a fantastic summer!<br />Trust the tide!
