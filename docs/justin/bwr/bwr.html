JUSTIN SOMPER
i guys! I hope you're having fun with the Big Wild Read. Have you worked out which books you're going to read over the summer yet? Knowing you lot, you've probably already got stuck in! I've just finished writing my third VAMPIRATES novel, BLOOD CAPTAIN. I find it quite hard to read other books when I'm writing one so I'm looking forward to making up for lost time over the summer. In fact, I've been building up a pile of possible reads on my bookcase. I'm going off to Australia for four weeks over the summer (their winter!) so I should get some good reading opportunities. It's mostly a holiday but I'm also going to be doing my first foreign author events (in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth), which I'm very excited about! <br />
If I have one piece of advice for you in terms of choosing your reading, it's to take a risk. I think it's really important - and fun - to vary what kind of books you read. Even if you have a favourite author or genre (as most of us do), it's well worth trying new writers and mixing up the genres too. Best of all, if you borrow the books from the library, it's no-risk because if they're really not your cup of tea, you can just take them back and start over. If any of you are budding writers, I reckon it's even more valuable to read as widely as you can - and then to experiment with your own writing style too. Remember, the long summer vacation is not just a great time to read lots but it's an excellent opportunity to try writing your very own short novel, or script or collection of poetry. If you're travelling to exciting new places, then make sure you take at least a small &ldquo;ideas book&rdquo; with you because you never know when inspiration will strike. Going to new places always get my imaginative juices going.<br />
I'm looking forward to receiving your comments and queries, but please be quick as I've already started my packing for Down Under! However, if you do have more questions for me, you can always check out vampirates.co.uk and send me an e-mail there. And, when I'm back in the UK this August, I'll be starting my own blog linked to the site. This should be a fun place to talk about reading and writing as well as pirates, vampires and the like.
<br />Trust the tide!
Justin Somper<br /><br />#1 Jake, from Perth W. Australia<br />Love the books. Fantastic fiction says that your third book is called "Dead Deep" but your site says third one is "Blood Captain". I'm confused but I can't wait.<br /><br />#2 Author<br />Hi Jake, the third main VAMPIRATES novel is BLOOD CAPTAIN. DEAD DEEP was a special book written for World Book Day in the UK. I see you're from Perth! I'm going to be there myself this time next week, and then back in August to do some author events ;-) Cannot wait!<br /><br />#3 Ellen, from Worthing<br />Your books are absolutely, amazingly brilliantly fantastic and I love them<br /><br />#4 PAULIO, from MADEIRA<br />OBRIGADO POR TUDO BJI DO PAULO SANTOS<br /><br />#5 sean, from me<br />I like all the books you have made<br /><br />#6 Luke, from Dalton<br />I read alot of books.  But this was my favourite.SO FAR<br /><br />#7 Milly, from London<br />I didt really like it cause its really horrible.  Cause its about blood.  Bloods horrible to look at.  Its red and ewwww!<br /><br />#8 Amari, from Amari<br />How you do all them books<br /><br />#9 ismeale, from ismeale<br />your books are brilliant<br /><br />#10 Joseph, from Berwick-Upon-Tweed<br />I loved reading your pirate adventures - as a boy did you like dressing up as a pirate? Are any of your characters based on real people you know?<br /><br />#11 Crystal Blue, from England<br />I am writing a book called Escort. It is about a boy called Billy who has to have an escort to take him to school, Billy thinks that his escort's life must be much better than his but Billy has got it all wrong! They help each other through their friendship. Do you like the sound of it? Can you please give me some tips?<br /><br />#12 Author<br />Crystal Blue (great name btw!), always good to hear from someone working on a story of their own. Yes I DO like the idea of your set-up. My advice would be to keep this story very focused on the two characters you mention. Play up the difference between what Billy thinks and what is really going on. You could do some nice &ldquo;edits&rdquo; between their journeys to school and the escort's own life. Good luck!<br /><br />#13 Evangeline, from Bridport<br />Hi i love 2 read and I'm writing a small book 4 my 11 year old sister coz she can't read so im going 2 read it 2 her. ur books sound really interesting so i might read them some time<br /><br />#14 Author<br />Evangeline, how cool that you read to - and write for - your kid sister. How lucky is she?!<br /><br />#15 rayanna, from shawbury<br />hi ive read nearly all ur books there brilliant and i love the idea (IN THE IST 2 BOOKS) that the twins get spilt up.  where do u get ur ideas from . my fav 1 is demons of the ocean ur books are the best!!!....PEACE!<br /><br />#16 Author<br />Rayanna, hello! Glad you're enjoying the books. I get ideas from all over the place. Sometimes the challenge is keeping track of them all! If you're into writing, I strongly suggest you start carrying an &ldquo;ideas book&rdquo; around with you. That way, you won't let any of the good ones get away!<br /><br />#17 Florence, from London<br />Hi Justin. Just writing to say that vampires and pirates make a very good combination. Hopefully one day I'll be able to write as well as you.<br /><br />#18 Author<br />Florence, glad you're enjoying the mix of pirates and vampires! I reckon the trick to developing as a writer is a) to read lots (and lots of different kinds of stuff) and b) to write lots. So keep at it and keep experimenting!!!<br /><br />#19 pauline, from essex<br />you rock!!!!!! you are sooo handsome!!!!!<br /><br />#20 Author<br />you're making me blush!<br /><br />#21 Emma, from England<br />I love vampires they are really cool and your books are cool as well this are all my m8s who think so Keleigh lucy sarah and many more xxxxx<br /><br />#22 joshua<br />hi i love ur books there cool<br /><br />#23 Thomas, from St Albans<br />We like living next door to your mummy!<br /><br />#24 Ellen, from Ellen<br />hi Justin i love your coments<br /><br />#25 Sophia, from London<br />I really love your book<br /><br />#26 kasim, from rotherham<br />i like his storys i am telling you i am not joking<br /><br />#27 Jasper, from London<br />I love your vampirates books, I've got most of your books, they're brilliant!<br /><br />#28 natalie, from midlesex<br />your book was fantastic
