			<h2>Here Is My Copy Of The Immortal War Blog Tour.</h2><br /><br /><h5>Here's more about Vampirates: Immortal War...</h5><br />"A bloody war is raging across the oceans, with the Pirate Federation and Nocturnals in alliance against the renegade Vampirates, led by Sidorio and Lola. Lola might be heavily pregnant with twins, but it doesn't stop her from remaining an active in battle! Connor and Grace Tempest each have important roles to play - he as a pirate warrior at the heart of the fight; she as a powerful healer working with the war-wounded. As the twins face their greatest challenges to date, old allies and foes return to play their part in the ultimate battle of Pirate versus Vampirate."<br /><br /><h2>EXTRACT: Vampirates: Immortal War by Justin Somper</h2><br /><h5>Chicklish is delighted to kick off the blog tour for Vampirates: Immortal War by Justin Somper with an exclusive extract from the book.<br />Read the extract below, published with the kind permission of Simon & Schuster.</h5><br /><br />Three ships coursed through the dark ocean, like a school of killer whales on the hunt. The Blood Captain was a nose ahead, flanked on its port side by The Albatross and, on starboard, by The Diablo. The three Vampirate vessels were closing in on a pirate galleon.<br /><br />Sidorio stood at the helm of his ship, hands on hips, surveying the figures racing back and forth across the target deck. Mortal eyes would have required night-vision goggles and an optical zoom to zero in on the scene. Sidorio&rsquo;s visual acuity was such that he could see far across the ocean, his ocean, with crystal clarity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get us there any faster?&rdquo; he asked the man at his side.<br />His question was met by a shake of the head. &ldquo;Regretfully no, Captain. We&rsquo;re making good speed but ours is a large ship. Besides, you wanted The Albatross and The Diablo to keep pace with us.&rdquo; <br /><br />The mention of the other two ships made Sidorio instantly nostalgic for their captains &ndash; Stukeley and Johnny Desperado. One of the few drawbacks of the ultra-rapid expansion of the Vampirate fleet was having to release his trusted deputies and bring up others from the ranks &ndash; like this babbo at his side.<br /><br />Well, thought Sidorio, Stukeley and Johnny might have their own ships now but they remained his joint deputies within the empire.<br /><br />Turning away from the imbecile at the wheel, Sidorio&rsquo;s fiery eyes sought out Stukeley, standing poised at the helm of The Albatross. The always reliable Stukeley turned and saluted his commander-in-chief, awaiting instructions.<br /><br />Smiling with satisfaction, Sidorio turned to his other side and found the reciprocal gaze of Johnny Desperado, captain of The Diablo. He too was ready to do his master&rsquo;s bidding.<br /><br />&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; Sidorio commanded.<br /><br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The man at his side jumped nervously and glanced at him in confusion.<br /><br />&ldquo;Not you, Lieutenant Jewell!&rdquo; Sidorio said, venting his impatience.<br /><br />&ldquo;Sorry, Captain!&rdquo; Lieutenant Jewell lifted one hand from the wheel to make a salute. With only one of his shaky hands on the wheel, the vast ship began to reel. They were never going to catch the pirate ship at this rate!<br /><br />Sidorio pushed the trembling lieutenant away from the wheel and took over. Immediately, the ship steadied itself, like a wanton horse brought under control by an expert rider. The captain turned and shouted over his shoulder. &ldquo;Is there anyone here capable of steering while I attend to business?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, Captain!&rdquo; A young-looking Vampirate &ndash; all ripped muscle and attitude - eagerly strode across the deck.<br /><br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Sidorio inquired.<br /><br />&ldquo;Caleb McDade,&rdquo; the Vampirate replied, saluting him. &ldquo;At your service!&rdquo;<br /><br />Sidorio smiled at the young man&rsquo;s eagerness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just been promoted, Caleb McDade,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take over from me.&rdquo;<br /><br />As he stepped aside, Sidorio bashed into the lately demoted Lieutenant Jewell. The captain surveyed the useless excuse for a Vampirate. <br /><br />&ldquo;With regret,&rdquo; Sidorio said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re fired!&rdquo;<br /><br />He lifted the bewildered lieutenant up by his armpits and stepped towards the very edge of the ship. Sidorio released his hands and Lieutenant Jewell made a hasty descent into the briny waters below.<br /><br />At the wheel, Caleb McDade grinned from ear to ear.<br /><br />&ldquo;I see we share a sense of humour,&rdquo; Sidorio said. &ldquo;Righto, time I was going. Keep your eyes on the ocean and your hands on the wheel, capisci?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, Captain!&rdquo; <br /><br />Sidorio felt satisfied that this one was up to the job.<br /><br />He glanced back to Stukeley, on board The Albatross, then to Johnny, at the helm of The Diablo. &ldquo;On the count of three!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One&hellip;. Two&hellip; Three.&rdquo; He propelled himself up into the air, flying high above the deck and next the dark, churning ocean itself. It was as if he was drawing the target ship effortlessly towards him, like a kite. Glancing swiftly to either side, he clocked Stukeley and Johnny soaring through the night air in the same direction. <br /><br />Sidorio let out a satisfied roar. Game on!<br /><br /><h5>Vampirates: Immortal War by Justin Somper is published in the UK by Simon & Schuster.<br />Check out the next stop on the tour tomorrow: an interview with Justin Somper at My Favourite Books.</h5><br /><br /><h2>Vampirates Ahoy! Day 2 of Justin Somper's Blog Tour</h2><br /><br /><h5>We are really proud to host Day 2 of Justin Somper's blog tour on MFB. Justin is the creator of the Vampirates sequence of books and they are roaringly good fun.&nbsp; We will be reviewing the final book "Immortal War" in July as part of our Under 14's Only month.&nbsp; In the meantime, I got to interview Justin about all and sundry.&nbsp; Check it out:</h5><br /><br /><br /><h5>When you started writing the Vampirates books, did you ever think the series would extend to six books?</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;When I first had the idea and began playing around with it, I knew that it was going to be too much material to fit into just one book. I had the idea to do the first book and then "suck it and see" after that (have to utilise all vampire puns while I still can!). It was my UK publisher, Simon & Schuster, who initiated the six book sequence. Initially, they bought four books and then decided, even before the first one was published, that they would like another two. I think there is mileage in the idea and characters to go even further without it getting tired, hence I have left a few loose threads at the end of IMMORTAL WAR. At the same time, I feel pretty satisfied at having written these six big books with all these characters in. It's been quite a journey for us all and hopefully the books have got better and more intriguing as the story has gone on.<br /><br /><h5>A lot happens in them &ndash; we have a lot of characters and great set-pieces &ndash; did you end up creating something like a series bible to keep it all straight in your head?</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;I've often been tempted to create this kind of bible but I've just never got around to it. Sometimes I do have to do a fair bit of referring back to the previous books but mostly all the characters are in my head. And of course I have a great team of editors, both in the UK and US, to keep me on the right path. But, going forward, with another project with lots of characters, I think I probably would create a bible from the get-go. <br /><br /><h5>I know my favourite character has to be Grace. Do you have a favourite Vampirates character? (we won&rsquo;t tell anyone, we promise).</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;I have many favourites! I could say Sidorio, because he consistently pushes the envelope, or Lola, because she takes it to the next level. But my favourite character might well be Stukeley. just think he's really complex and intriguing. He was only ever intended to appear briefly in TIDE OF TERROR and die, end of. I didn't expect Sidorio to sire him or Stukeley to still be there, in IMMORTAL WAR, but there he is. I like how conflicted he is between his new existence and the life, and comrades, he's left behind. I like the way he sometimes seems drawn back to goodness, but then the darkness takes hold of him. The chapter in BLOOD CAPTAIN where he returns to Ma Kettle's Tavern is one of my favourites across the whole sequence. One of my favourite characters in IMMORTAL WAR is Moonshine Wrathe. <br /><br /><h5>How much research did you find you had to do? I am talking about weapons research, about pirates, about vampires and of course, about ships and sailing for the books?</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;I have pretty much had to do constant research for these books. Thank goodness for google! Obviously, the big initial research was into pirate history and vampire myth, to work out how best to fuse the two strands together and also to start developing characters. As the sequence continued, I did a load of research on mermaid myths for DEAD DEEP, as I worked on creating Kally and the fishtails. For BLOOD CAPTAIN, research work went into creating the geography and ritual of Sanctuary, as well as researching real-life cowboys as Johnny Desperado made his debut in the story. Originally Johnny was going to be a blue-eyed, blonde-haired all-American cowboy but as I researched, I found the vacqueros more intriguing and I figured Grace would too! We both like real outsider figures. Then for BLACK HEART, it was all about wine as I brought in Lola! Weapons research has been a constant too - for Sidorio and Connor's duel in EMPIRE OF NIGHT, say. My dad was an enthusiastic amateur sailor and he helped me with the sailing scenes in the first book. I also got the chance to go on the Cutty Sark a couple of times, which gave me the feel for the size and height of the ships. It all feeds in. <br /><br /><h5>In a dream situation, should Jerry Bruckheimer knock on your door and say: &ldquo;Justin, we want to turn Vampirates into a movie, who do you think should play your main characters?&rdquo; What would your answer be and remember, money is no object.</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;LOL. I know that in reality I probably wouldn't get much say about this but it's a fun game to play! I would pay good money to see Angelina Jolie as Lady Lola. When I first wrote Sidorio, I thought of him as Vin Diesel but in the later books, he's become more Javier Bardem. I'd like to see George Clooney in there too, maybe as Molucco Wrathe. There's been waves of Hollywood interest in a VAMPIRATES movie and I know the Nocturnals are keen on this, so you never know!<br /><br /><h5>I wanted to ask you about book 4 in the series: Black Heart. It is, for me, the book most tense book, with the Biggest Reveal. Did you anguish about writing this one at all?</h5><br /><br />That's very perceptive of you. All the books have presented me with different challenges but BLACK HEART and IMMORTAL WAR were probably the toughest of the six. With BLACK HEART, there was the real stress of revealing the twins' true parentage. And, by the way, this was not a plot I had planned from the outset of the sequence. As the books were read and got more and more popular, I was getting a lot of questions from readers, and noise online, debating Grace and Connor's real background so I decided to really crank up that sense of mystery towards the end of BLOOD CAPTAIN and then tackle it head on in BLACK HEART. The way that Grace and Connor were conceived was potentially problematic given the broad age range of my readers, so I had to be really careful at how this was depicted. Then there was Sally's return which was hard to write. The first draft of the book had lots of chapters where Sally told her story to Grace. My wise UK editor slashed her red pencil straight through about eleven of these and we then put our heads together to work out a more engaging - emotional but unsentimental - way to tell that back story. The answer became to have Grace, with her growing psychic powers, effectively step into Sally's memories and become her. This changed the whole feel of the book for the better. Then we had, as you say, the reveal of the true nature of Grace and Connor and that was stressful too as it wasn't something I'd intended from the outset. I worried that I was taking the sequence into too dark a place but, at the same time, it felt right. The sequence has become more epic and darker than I originally envisaged it. With all this going on, I couldn't find room to bring back the Vampirate captain in this book which is why his return is delayed until EMPIRE OF NIGHT.<br /><br /><h5>With The Immortal War, you bring the Vampirates sequence of books to a close. What was the most difficult / emotional thing for you to write (without spoilers) in this one?</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;I found writing the whole of this book surprisingly emotional and difficult. It has an elegiac feel from the outset and you'll see there are clocks everywhere you turn in the story, showing that time is ticking away. The challenge this time was bringing the story to a pause, if not a complete close, and giving all the key characters a chance to say goodbye to the readers who have journeyed through six books with them. Some characters get their happy ending but others don't. With EMPIRE OF NIGHT, I actually cried when I was writing the final death scene - most unusual! With IMMORTAL WAR, the whole writing process was quite challenging and raw in some ways. And again one departure resulted in minor waterworks. I'm still too close to this book to know how good a job I've done. I'll have to await (nervously) your, and other reader's, verdict.<br /><br /><h5>I have always read the Vampirates books to background music &ndash; mostly soundtracks as it calls for stirring music. Did you ever do a soundtrack for yourself whilst writing?</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;I never write with music in the background - that just doesn't work for me. But there are pieces of music that I used to "warm up" for certain scenes and characters and other music which has inspired some of my writing. I've been asked to put together a VAMPIRATES playlist and you can find this both on GIRLS WITHOUT A BOOKSHELF and at www.vampirates.co.uk.<br /><br /><h5>And I hate asking this, but I know a lot of your (and my) readers would love to know...what&rsquo;s next for you?</h5><br /><br />That's a nice question! I've got several ideas but one seems to have pushed itself to the fore so I'm doing some research and starting to play around with characters, setting etc. I don't want to say too much more in case it doesn't work, or is superceded by another idea, but it's another "enclosed world" story with a lot of strong, conflicted characters, with various shades of morality. I'd envisage it appealing to the same readers who enjoy VAMPIRATES, though there will be no vampires or pirates in this one!<br /><br /><h5>Final question, one of my favourites as an aspiring writer. It&rsquo;s a two-parter: <br />a) what is your advice to aspiring writers out there and <br />b) what was the best advice you were given when you started out?</h5><br /><br />&nbsp;My advice to aspiring writers is fairly simple - <br />1) read as often as you can and as widely as you can, so that you are open to the diverse ways different writers use language and tell stories, <br />2) write as often as you can and push yourself to try new things in your writing and don't get trapped into one genre all the time and <br />3) don't give up - the third one is essentially what separates those of us who are published and those who aren't. The best advice I was given was when author Jan Mark did a writing workshop at my school and advised the seventeen year-old me not to depend on writing to make a living! I've been lucky with the success of my books both in the UK and overseas, but it's nice not to have to write to earn money. That's a pressure I don't really want to introduce to my writing. Besides which, having other strings to my bow, helps keep me enjoying my writing and having fresh ideas to bring to it.<br /><br /><h2>Blog Tour Day Three - VAMPIRATES by Justin Somper</h2><br /><br /><h5>Y'all I am super SUPER pleased to welcome Mr Somper to The Crooked Shelf, because oh my goodness, this guest post truly kicks some ass. &nbsp;If you like your girls to be strong and fiesty and not mard and whiny, then you are going to LUUUUURVE Lola like woah. &nbsp;The final book in the series, Immortal War, is published on 9 June, in case you guys were wondering when you could experience this amazingness. &nbsp;And here is the man himself.....</h5><br /><br />From the very beginnings of the VAMPIRATES saga, I was always keen to put strong women characters at the centre of the action. So you have Cheng Li, young and ambitious deputy of The Diablo, and &ldquo;Cutlass&rdquo; Cate Morgan in charge of weapons and attack strategy. And of course there&rsquo;s Grace Tempest, the heroine of the sequence, who has a quiet strength from the beginning, which builds book by book. But, all things considered, I think the strongest of all my female characters is Lola Lockwood Sidorio. If VAMPIRATES was a TV show, she&rsquo;d definitely be the one who comes at the end of the credits!<br /><br />Where did Lola come from? Well, by the time I&rsquo;d written the third main novel in the sequence, BLOOD CAPTAIN, I took stock of my cast of characters and felt as though I was now in a similar position to a director on &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo; or &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, with a large and unwieldy mob to assign storylines to. I was generally pleased with the division of characters between the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; and the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; at this point in the saga. Heading up the rogue Vampirates, I had Sidorio, with his two &ldquo;young&rdquo; deputies Johnny Desperado and (Jez) Stukeley. But I realised I had a vacancy. Though there were strong women all over the story, there was no truly evil female Vampirate. That&rsquo;s what I was looking for from Lola and she has more than delivered on that promise.<br /><br />In the saga, her origin story is that she was a bored aristocrat who decided to spice up her life by becoming a Highwaywoman. She was killed mysteriously during an attack and crossed over into the vampire realm. In time, seeing that there were opportunities to build power on the oceans, she decided to become a Vampirate captain and started her small but deadly ship, The Vagabond, with its all female crew.<br /><br />Lola was inspired by Lady Barbara Skelton, the lead character in the 1945 movie &ldquo;The Wicked Lady&rdquo; starring Margaret Lockwood, and by the main character Lady Dona St Columb in Daphne DuMaurier&rsquo;s novel, Frenchman&rsquo;s Creek. In the first, a bored aristo decides to become a Highwaywoman; in the second, another bored aristo takes up with a pirate. My bored aristo does both and then some!<br /><br />Visually, I wanted Lola to be as glamorous as Angelina Jolie. I got the idea for her black heart tattoo from a fashion spread in Vanity Fair magazine, where one of the models is sporting a &ldquo;spades&rdquo; motif around her eyes. It&rsquo;s always important to me to get an idea of how my characters talk and with Lola, I thought back to Margaret Lockwood and that peculiar &lsquo;clipped&rsquo; way of talking by British actors of that era. I think that Lola&rsquo;s upper-crust Britishness and her obsession with manners makes a useful counterpoint to her villainy. I love the fact that she can be serving you tea in a china cup one minute and have a knife in your heart moments later.&nbsp;<br /><br />Originally, she was going to be Lady Angelika Lockwood, but I thought that the alliteration of Lady Lola Lockwood worked just that bit better. I then heard the old song, &ldquo;Whatever Lola Wants&hellip; Lola gets!&rdquo;, and, frankly, that sealed the deal.<br /><br />Lola has given me some of my favourite scenes across the sequence. Two that stand out are her rather gothic wedding in BLACK HEART (which I had to keep rewriting to make weirder and wilder) and her Siberian honeymoon in EMPIRE OF NIGHT. But I think my favourite Lola moments are in the new book, IMMORTAL WAR. There&rsquo;s a nice scene where she feeds blood to her newborn babies, and another where she consults a very particular set of Tarot cards. Earlier in the story, we see her in attack mode though heavily pregnant. Like many of her scenes, it&rsquo;s brutally horrific but with a hefty dose of humour.<br /><br />I think in general with Lola&rsquo;s arrival in the books, I got a better handle on how to do horror and also how to balance it with laughs. Many of the scenes I&rsquo;ve had the most fun writing are those featuring Lola and Sidorio together. &nbsp;He has become a more intriguing, and perhaps more sympathetic, character since he met her.<br /><br />So there you have it. Lola wasn&rsquo;t even a glint in my eye when I embarked on writing the VAMPIRATES books several years ago, but I&rsquo;m prepared to wager that she&rsquo;s one of my most memorable creations. It was hard writing her last scene. One of the reviews of VAMPIRATES of which I&rsquo;m proudest was &ldquo;Lady Lola Lockwood makes Cruella de Ville look like Mary Poppins&rdquo;.

I&rsquo;ve never been tempted to write Vampirate dogs into the books. I&rsquo;ve done Vampirate cowboys and I&rsquo;ve done Vampirate highwaywomen but I think Vampirate dogs really would be a step too far! Nor have I drawn on either dog&rsquo;s personality to develop a character based on them &ndash; though I inherited Bella from previous owners and one of her former names was Lola! How spooky is that? I&rsquo;m glad that when I got her, she was already responding to Bella. It would have been too weird for me crying out &ldquo;Lola!&rdquo; as I walked around the woods in the morning.<br /><br />If anything, I&rsquo;m tempted to say, my dogs &ndash; much as I love them - are a positive hindrance to the creative process. Not least when I have my huge chapter-grids laid out on my office floor and they come in and sit on them or make off with one of my vital post-it notes!<br /><br />But actually thinking about it, they are a part of the writing process. Pretty much every morning, I take them for a walk first thing &ndash; around the woods or across the heath near where I live in North London. This walk is quality time with them. You only have to spend time with dogs to see that a walk isn&rsquo;t just about physical exercise &ndash; it&rsquo;s complete mental and sensory overload for them! But for me, the morning walk, serves another purpose. It can be a meditative start to the day and it&rsquo;s certainly a great opportunity to ponder where I&rsquo;m at in the book and any niggling problems regarding the plot or characters. It&rsquo;s amazing how beneficial repetitive exercise is for resolving such conundrums. I&rsquo;m often asked how to prevent or combat &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rdquo; and my two answers are 1) to plan out the story in advance (hence my chapter grids) and 2) if you get stuck to go for a walk or a swim etc.<br /><br /><h5>Thank you so much for visiting today Justin, I love all the pictures of Bailey & Bella - I have to admit the ones with the reinder antlers are my favourites!&nbsp; Justin is currently taking part in a blog tour to celebrate the release of the final book in the Vampirates series, Immortal War.&nbsp; If you haven't yet discovered this series it really is one you should check out!&nbsp; Don't forget to check out the other tour stops too (you can find a list on my sidebar).&nbsp; I'll be posting my review of Immortal War later today but I'll tell you now that I thought it was my favourite book in the series and rounded things off really well.</h5><br /><br /><h2>Immortal War Blog Tour: Extract</h2><br /><br /><h5>Today I am delighted to be hosting the Immortal War Blog Tour. The Vampirates have stopped by to let you have a glimpse into the final instalment of their journey. So without further ado, here is a sneaky peek:</h5><br /><br /><h5>Extract #2 Immortal War (Vampirates 6) by Justin Somper, 2011</h5><br />On the deck of the pirate ship, Captain Jack Fallico was held fast in the clutches of Mimma and Holly, two of the feistiest Vampirates on Lola Lockwood-Sidorio&rsquo;s crew. Captain Fallico was the only pirate left standing. The others lay scattered across the deck like so much flotsam and jetsam, their prostrate bodies silvery-grey in the meagre light of the ship&rsquo;s lanterns. Lola&rsquo;s crew &ndash; dark-cloaked shadows - were busy at work, harvesting the blood of the newly dead.<br /><br />The pirate captain had put up a fight for a time, lashing and spitting at his captors. Now, at last, he seemed reconciled to his fate. His eyes gave a final flash of fire at the deliverer of his doom: Lady Lola Lockwood-Sidorio.<br /><br />&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to kill me, just kill me,&rdquo; said the pirate captain bravely.<br /><br />Lola arched an eyebrow, giving nothing away. Feeling pleasantly giddy, she sniffed the air. The aroma of different blood types commingling on the deck was utterly intoxicating. She was already contemplating the intriguing new blends she could create from tonight&rsquo;s harvest.&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Captain Fallico snarled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of this! You&rsquo;ve massacred my crew and taken my ship. You&rsquo;re obviously going to kill me too, so stop playing games and just get on with it, you vile, bloated vampire!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Bloated?&rdquo; Lady Lola stepped closer to her prey, the heels of her thigh-high sharkskin boots drumming on the bloodstained deck. &ldquo;Bloated? How dare you! I&rsquo;m not bloated, you mortal fool. I&rsquo;m eight and a half months pregnant!&rdquo; She lifted her cloak and proudly displayed her belly, snug under her maternity top. Rubbing it proudly, she stepped forward and seized Captain Fallico&rsquo;s rapier from where it had fallen onto the deck in front of him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Live by the sword&hellip;&rdquo; Lola began.<br /><br />&ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; exclaimed Mimma.<br /><br />Seeing the look in her deputy&rsquo;s eyes, Lola paused. Killing a captain was a moment to savour - like uncorking a bottle long stored in the cellar and breathing in its heady perfume. Mimma must have good reason to interrupt her at a moment like this.<br /><br />Behind her, Lola now heard the whistling of air, followed by a thud.<br /><br />Turning, she saw her husband land on the deck, a few metres from her. Her face froze in dismay as Stukeley and Johnny dropped down on either side of him.<br /><br />Rapier still poised, Lola frowned at Sidorio. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she asked, no trace of warmth in her cut-glass voice.<br /><br />Sidorio&rsquo;s jaw hung open. &ldquo;What are you doing here? It&rsquo;s almost your due date. You&rsquo;re supposed to be taking it easy.&rdquo; His eyes glanced protectively at his wife&rsquo;s bulge.<br /><br />Lola rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Must we have this conversation again? There are two types of pregnant women,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;those who lie around for months reading magazines and demanding foot-rubs, and the other category, to which I belong, who continue to attend to business.&rdquo;<br /><br />With that, she turned away, lifted her sword and skewered Captain Fallico.<br /><br />As he fell meatily to the deck, Holly swiftly plugged in her draining apparatus and began bottling his blood. It was the last of a good haul. From the edges of the deck, others of Lola&rsquo;s crew now came forward, stepping over their victims. Each carried the standard issue black case, which now held half a dozen bottles of recently harvested pirate.<br /><br />&ldquo;Good work, ladies!&rdquo; Lola said, standing proudly before her crew, as Holly snapped shut her case and strode into position beside her. &ldquo;Holly, Camille&hellip; next job for you. You know that quaint tradition the pirates have of putting a Nocturnal on each of their ships?&rdquo;<br /><br />The girls nodded.<br /><br />&ldquo;Doubtless, he or she will be hiding below-deck,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;Find them and bring them up to me.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Dead or undead?&rdquo; Camille inquired.<br /><br />Lola laughed lightly. &ldquo;Undead, if you please. We&rsquo;re going to play a little game with the opposition.&rdquo; Her eyes searched the crowd. &ldquo;Jessamy, Nathalie - fetch the package from The Vagabond, if you please. The rest of you can start clearing up the deck.&rdquo;<br /><br />At her words, her crew sprang into action. Jack Fallico&rsquo;s husk of a body was the first to hit the water.<br /><br /><h5>Next stop: Tomorrow over at Girls without a Bookshelf where you can listen to the playlist and music of the Vampirates...<br />Many thanks to Simon and Schuster for inviting me to take part.</h5><br /><br /><h2>Immortal War Blog Tour: Playlists & The Music of Vampirates!</h2><br /><br /><h5>Hello Vampirates fans! Welcome to the sixth stop at Justin Somper's Vampirates: Immortal War blog tour. I'm sure a lot of you have been enjoying the treats from this exciting blog tour so far and there's more fun to come! Today we get a glimpse at Justin's tastes in music as he reveals the music behind Vampirates!<br />Check it out below!<br /><br />VAMPIRATES: PLAYLIST<br />Warning: this is a decidedly eclectic mix!</h5><br /><br />1. MC Sultan - Der Bauch (Arabesque) &ndash; I don&rsquo;t usually listen to music when I&rsquo;m actually writing or about to write but this track was my inspiration for the mesmeric music used to annouce Feast Night.<br /><br />2. Camille O&rsquo;Sullivan - Whatever Lola Wants (A Little Yearning) &ndash; &ldquo;Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets. And, little man, little Lola wants you!&rdquo; Originally she was going to be called Lady Angelika Lockwood but I though the alliteration of Lady Lola Lockwood sounded better and then the lyrics to this song removed any further uncertainty.<br /><br />3. Jay-Z, Rihanna & Kanye West - Run This Town &ndash; This was chosen by the Nocturnal who won a competition on vampirates.co.uk to select Sidorio&rsquo;s theme song. Actually, it also connects with my characterisation of the pirates. Warning: some versions of this have explicit lyrics!<br /><br />4. The Eagles &ndash; Desperado (Very Best of) &ndash; &ldquo;Desperado, why don&rsquo;t you come to your senses?... These things that are pleasing you can hurt you somehow.&rdquo; Every cowboy Vampirate needs a theme tune and this is Johnny&rsquo;s.<br /><br />5. Carter Burwell &ndash; End Titles (Theme from Miller&rsquo;s Crossing) &ndash; If Lorcan had a theme, it might just be this. It would take him right back to his Celtic routes.<br /><br />6. The Wannadies &ndash; You and Me &ndash; This song makes me think of Connor and Grace. As much as circumstances tear them apart, they will always be united.<br /><br />7. Jack Johnson &ndash; A Pirate Looks at Forty &ndash; I just really like this song. &ldquo;Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call. I&rsquo;ve wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall&hellip; you&rsquo;ve seen it all.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say it was a good anthem for Cheng Li if it wasn&rsquo;t so mellow! Maybe for Bo Yin then.<br /><br />8. Norah Jones &ndash; Chasing Pirates (The Fall) &ndash; Both this song and its accompanying video me think of Jasmine and her often challenging relationships with Jacoby and Connor.<br /><br />9. Carla Bruni &ndash; You Belong to Me (Comme si de rien n&rsquo;etait) &ndash; Bruni&rsquo;s fragile voice and the romantic lyrics makes me think this is the kind of song Darcy might have sung aboard the Titania before its fateful crash. With its theme of exploring the world, this might also be a fitting song for Grace and Lorcan too.<br /><br />10. Coldplay &ndash; Viva la Vida &ndash; This song has a strong sense of power lost and power won. It was one of those rare pieces of music that I did listen to to get me in the mood for writing. It made me think of both Sidiorio and Stukeley. <br /><br />11. Sam Sparro &ndash; Black & Gold &ndash; Lots of oceanic and nocturnal lyrics here and I reckon this could be a great summary of Sid&rsquo;s feelings for Lola. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not really here, then I don&rsquo;t want to be either.&rdquo;<br /><br />12. 6 Day Riot &ndash; Reinkarnation of Take the time (The Folie a Deux LP) &ndash; I love this band and their distinctive sound. I met them at a radio show and have seen them live. This song is nostalgic yet timeless and suffused with yearning. It&rsquo;s the kind of mood I&rsquo;ve often tried to capture in the books. Incidentally, I wrote the group into EMPIRE OF NIGHT (they&rsquo;re the ones massacred by Sid and Lola on their honeymoon!). It was my idea of a tribute!<br /><br />13. Marianne Faithful - Pirate Jenny (20th Century Blues) &ndash; The Nina Simone version is on the <a href="../../ideas/dolphin/dolphin.html" rel="self" title="Dirty Dolphin">Dirty Dolphin jukebox</a> at Vampirates fansite www.tempesttwins.co.uk, which reminded me that this song was a definite inspiration for the books and, in particular, for Ma Kettle &ndash; the character and the tavern. Though it&rsquo;s more likely it would be Sugar Pie who would sing this song than Ma! Warning: explicit lyrics in Marianne&rsquo;s version!<br /><br />14. Neil Diamond &ndash; Captain of a Shipwreck &ndash; A gem of a song (no pun intended!) from Neil Diamond. His voice as well as the lyrics make me think of Molucco&rsquo;s awkward relationship with Connor. <br /><br />15. Nina Simone &ndash; Here Comes the Sun (Soho Hotel) &ndash; a beautiful song with rather sinister implications for a number of my characters, especially in IMMORTAL WAR. If VAMPS ever does become a movie, this song might be a cool choice for the closing credits.<br /><br /><h5>BONUS TRACKS</h5><br /><br />16. Jeff Buckley &ndash; Grace (Mojo Pin). A small but nonetheless heartfelt tribute to my infinitely accomplished heroine.<br /><br />17. Ottmar Liebert & Luna Negra &ndash; Snakecharmer (The Hours Between Night and Day) &ndash; for Scrimshaw. Picture the scene&hellip;. Molucco&rsquo;s cabin. Two old comrades. A plate of honeyed dates. Sheer bliss!<br /><br />18. Angus &&nbsp;Julia Stone &ndash; I&rsquo;m Not Yours (Down the Way) &ndash; a haunting song that makes me think of the complicated relationship between Darcy and Stukeley and in particular their return encounter in IMMORTAL WAR.<br /><br /><h5>You can also check out some of the songs in the playlist below, or <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/sandskids/playlist/4tFqfqmZi3uXBAqXk1AAYc" rel="self">click HERE to listen on Spotify!</a></h5><br /><br /><h2>Immortal War Blog Tour: 10 Ways to Know You're Obsessed with Vampirates</h2><br /><br /><h5>Justin Somper's sixth and final Vampirates book, Immortal War, was published in the UK last week, and there's a blog tour to celebrate! The full listing of blogs and dates can be found here, and the tour ends on June 16th. Hope you've been enjoying it so far!<br /><br />I think most people who know me know I'm obsessed with vampires. Pirates on their own, not so much (unless he's called Jack Sparrow), but if you put them both together then I'm on board. Vampirates is one of the coolest mash-ups I've ever heard of, so well done Justin - my vampire loving self approves! Here's 10 reasons you know you're obsessed. How many can YOU tick off?</h5><br /><br />10 Ways to Know You're Obsessed with Vampirates<br /><br />	&bull;	You've legally changed your name to Lady Lola Lockwood.<br />	&bull;	You dress like a vampire pirate. Every day.<br />	&bull;	You're going to name your first child Grace or Connor Tempest depending which one arrives first. They'll be the greatest pirates who ever lived, with auburn hair and bright green eyes.<br />	&bull;	You refer to Justin Somper as 'The Captain'.<br />	&bull;	You vehemently refuse to see any of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Unless it has 'Vamp' in the title, you're just not interested.<br />	&bull;	You have a tattoo of your favourite Vampirates book cover. (Not recommended: your parents still haven't forgiven you!)<br />	&bull;	You practise sword fighting for an hour a day. You need to be prepared for when you meet Sidorio.<br />	&bull;	You attend Twilight movie premieres with a home-made banner saying 'Team Lorcan'. Your mission: to show every sparkly vampire fan what they're missing.<br />	&bull;	Instead of doing geography homework, you use the time to perfect your map reading skills. One day you'll sail on the high seas...<br />	&bull;	You part-own a boat. It took a *lot* of paying for!<br /><br /><h2>Immortal War Blog Tour: Justin Somper on Killing Off Vampirates!</h2><br /><br /><h5>I'm delighted to welcome Justin Somper to the blog today. Immortal War, the sixth and final book in his much loved Vampirates series has just been released, and here Justin talks about saying goodbye to the series a.k.a Killing Off Vampirates!</h5><br /><br />I was a bit alarmed when I was asked to write a blog titled, &ldquo;Killing Off Vampirates&rdquo;! I hadn&rsquo;t really thought of it like that before. Yes, the sixth main novel in the sequence, IMMORTAL WAR is the last VAMPIRATES novel &ndash; for now at least - but &ldquo;killing off&rdquo; sounds so brutal and final! Very Sidorio. Very Lola.<br /><br />Writing IMMORTAL WAR was a very different experience for me to writing the five previous novels in the VAMPIRATES sequence. To be honest, each book has brought fresh challenges, not least as I&rsquo;ve pushed myself to &ldquo;raise the bar&rdquo; each time. I&rsquo;ve also worked hard to make the books feel different so that, as a reader, you don&rsquo;t have the sense of reading the same book you read a year ago but with a different jacket! It&rsquo;s important to me that the mood and characters evolve.<br /><br />With the first five books, I had the luxury of knowing that there would be another book (at least) in which to continue the story and the characters&rsquo; evolution. With such a big cast of characters, it was reassuring to know that if one of them didn&rsquo;t get enough &ldquo;screen time&rdquo; this time around, I could address that in the next book. But that all changed when I set out to write IMMORTAL WAR. This was going to be the &ldquo;last hurrah&rdquo; and if the characters were going to go through major crises, they had to happen &ndash; and be resolved &ndash; now. The pressure was on!<br /><br />Not surprisingly then, IMMORTAL War is probably packed with more incident than any of the other VAMPIRATES books. It had to be, to get through all the changes I wanted to get through. But it suited this book &ndash; my &ldquo;War book&rdquo; &ndash; for that to be the case too. Initially, I was rather intimidated by the idea of writing a &ldquo;War book&rdquo;. It felt like potentially a challenge too far. But then I realised that for my characters, and readers too, the internal wars were going to be just as important as the big external conflict. That&rsquo;s always been the case in Vampirates &ndash; the story is very much driven by the characters and their inner battles.<br /><br />Beyond telling an engaging, page-turning story, I wanted to give all the key characters a chance to bid farewell to the readers, especially those readers who started out with DEMONS OF THE OCEAN and have made their way through each book in turn. I feel exceedingly proud and privileged to have made this journey with my readers. I also wanted to bring Grace and Connor Tempest&rsquo;s voyage to an appropriate conclusion or, at least pause. Frankly, these kids deserve a rest!<br /><br />As you&rsquo;ll see, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that every last plot thread is tied up. There are definite loose threads hanging at the end of the book and that is intentional &ndash; though the intent is to intrigue rather than frustrate the reader. I wanted the sense that the characters &ndash; at least, those that make it to the end of Book 6 - will go on with their business, whether or not they return again in book form.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m already being asked &ndash; &ldquo;is this really the end?&rdquo; Well, it&rsquo;s certainly the last for now. After six years and six books (plus DEAD DEEP), I think it makes sense to take a break and try writing something completely fresh. When I came up with the idea for Vampirates, it was before the trend for pirates and for vampire fiction. Boy, have things changed! There are SO many vampire books out there now and it&rsquo;s time for me to break away from that pack. My head is buzzing with ideas and I&rsquo;m already researching something which I think might be my next big project. It&rsquo;s fun being back in the beginnings of a project, with all the uncertainties and possibilities that brings.<br /><br />In many ways, I have achieved more with the Vampirates books than I could ever have imagined. It&rsquo;s not simply a question of book sales or the number of countries where the books are available (though this is incredibly gratifying). It&rsquo;s more about my development as a writer and keeping the characters and story developing over six books, and keeping a good number of readers with me through that journey. That, in the end, is what I&rsquo;m proudest of.<br /><br />So one voyage comes to an end and another surely begins. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what lies ahead but that makes it all the more exciting, don&rsquo;t you think?<br /><br /><h5>Many thanks to Justin for the great guest post!&nbsp; The Immortal War blog tour continues tomorrow at Empire of Books.</h5><br /><br /><h2>Immortal War Blog Tour: Top 10 Vampirates Characters</h2><br /><br /><h5>Wow. When I was asked to do this by the lovely people at S&S I thought, wow... what an easy subject. Cannot wait! It was only upon sitting down to write this that I realised that it was not easy. Far from it. It has to have been one of the hardest pieces I've done for the blog, be it part of a Blog Tour or not. Really hard. So thanks to S&S and Justin for giving me the challenge!</h5><br /><br />10) Stukely - Now, not initially one of my favourite characters I couldn't stand him towards the start of the series. Crewmate to Connor turned Vampirate, he always annoyed me when he popped up and being Sidorio's sidekick he just kept coming. But as the series has progressed I've come to really enjoy him as a character. He still has some good in his dried Vampirate husk of a body, and it's buried so deep that all he can seem to do is highlight his flaws.&nbsp;<br /><br />9) Bo Yin - The innocent, odd, daughter of a swordsmith, she's been a favourite since she first appeared in Blood Captain. Her innocence always makes me smile and is sometimes a good remedy to the darkness going on in the rest of the books.<br /><br />8) Mollucco Wraithe - Captain of The Diablo, and a mighty fine pirate. He sure does have his moments of annoyance but he just seems to be one of those characters. Wheter you agree with him, or what he does, or not, you cannot help but like him.&nbsp;<br /><br />7) Kally - A fishtail (mermaid) who appears in Dead Deep, the novella Justin wrote for World Book Day and then again throughout the subsequent books. She doesn't really have any series-changing moments, but she's a fun little addition and always brightens things up whenever she pops up for air.<br /><br />6) Darcy Flotsam - Figurehead of the mysterious Nocturn by day, regular Vampirate by night, she's been a consistent source of wisdom for Grace. Other characters waver in their wisdom, The Captain, Lorcan, because they always seem to have other interests at heart, and as we learn throughout the series, secrets to keep, but Darcy always has this sense of honesty about her which I really like and draws me to her as a character. The only downside is that the poor girl is only looking for true love and it seems so far away for her.<br /><br />5) Lady Lola - One of the most wicked characters in the series, possibly even more than the big bad himself, Sidorio. She is a complete puppet master. Pulling the strings to get what she wants, when she wants. With a chilling tendancy to bottle the blood of her victims and savour it rather like wine, she's a highlight on the oceans!<br /><br />4) The Vampirate Captain - A complete enigma throughout the series, this guy creeped me out majorly in the first few books, and also in the latter, but more so in the early days of the series. The whole mask situation and how his voice never exceeds a whisper even when angry. Creepy creepy dude!<br /><br />3) Lorcan Furey - An important character all the way throughout the series, and a constant love interest for Grace, Lorcan is the loveable Irish vamp frozen forever in his nineteen year old body. Plucking Grace from the ocean in the first book, Demons of the Ocean, it was clear from the start that he'd be one to watch!<br /><br />2) Grace and Connor Tempest - Our main characters. Yes, they are technically two different characters, but as they're twins, I'm grouping them together. They've had a tumultuous journey throughout the series, being shipwrecked and finding themselves on two completely different ships, fighting for their lives in a world of piracy and vampires, no real Top 10 could exist without them.<br /><br />And so it comes down to this, the Number 1 spot.&nbsp;<br /><br />1) Sidorio - Yes, I know, I hear you. WHAT?! WHAT????!!! Are you mad? You name Sidorio the number 1 Vamps character of all time?! Well guess, what, yes I do? Love him or hate him he is one cracking character! With his golden insisors which puncture his victims bodies to feast on their blood, and his Roman-esque wardrobe and ways, he truly is the self-styled King of the Vampirates. You cannot fault his enthusiasm, no matter how many knockbacks he takes, he won't stop until he gets what he wants. He is definitely a favourite character of mine, no matter how much I try I like him just as much as I am repulsed by him. He, more than any other character in the series has caused greater effect on me, and so therefore he is my Number 1 Vampirates Character!<br /><br /><h5>So what do you think? Who are your favourite Vampirates characters?! Leave your comments below!<br />Thanks to Justin and S&S for allowing me to do this. It's been a lot of fun! Be sure to check out the series if you haven't already done so, and if you have, do not miss out on Immortal War!<h5><br /><br /><h2>*** Immortal War Blog Tour: Interview with Justin Somper (author of the Vampirates series)</h2><br /><br /><h5>Today we are joined by Justin Somper, author of the brilliant Vampirates series. Justin has been visiting a number of blogs on his Immortal War blog tour, and we are his penultimate stop on the tour.&nbsp;</h5><br /><br /><h5>Hi Justin. Thanks for stopping by The Book Zone to answer some questions for us. Firstly, now that the Vampirates saga has come to an end, how would you describe the series to someone discovering it for the first time?</h5><br /><br />I&rsquo;m always having to do this at school events so, here goes&hellip; 500 years into the future, the oceans have risen and there&rsquo;s a new golden age of piracy. If you want to make something of yourself in this world, you have to be a pirate &ndash; the Pirate Federation controls the oceans and even has a special school, the Pirate Academy. The oceans are teeming with pirate ships and at least one rather special pirate ship. Teenage twins Connor and Grace Tempest are shipwrecked off the coast of Eastern Australia and almost drown. He&rsquo;s rescued by a passing pirate ship; she&rsquo;s rescued &ndash; if that&rsquo;s the right word &ndash; by a ship of Vampirates. Neither Connor nor Grace&rsquo;s life will ever be the same again. Howzat? <br /><br /><h5>When you wrote Demons of the Ocean did you ever envisage that it would become a popular series of six books?</h5><br /><br />I guess I knew from the moment I got the idea for Vampirates that it had the potential to run to a sequence of books. My initial UK contract was for four books so I knew even when I was writing DEMONS that there would some big story arcs. Just before DEMONS was published, I was signed up for Books 5 & 6 too, which was quite strange but nice. It was good knowing from that point how many books I was likely have to play with in order to tell the story and develop the characters. <br /><br /><h5>Do you have a favourite book from the Vampirates series?</h5><br /><br />That&rsquo;s a tough one to answer. I have tried to push myself so that each of the books eclipses the one before. I&rsquo;m still a bit too close to IMMORTAL WAR to know if I&rsquo;ve achieved that this time and, in any case, it&rsquo;s a slightly different book because it does draw together a lot of threads. But there are certainly things in IMMORTAL WAR which I&rsquo;m proud of and which I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have managed to pull off proficiently until now. If it isn&rsquo;t IMWA, then it would be EMPIRE OF NIGHT. Having Connor and Grace stay with Sidorio and Lola offered up a lot of fun opportunities. <br /><br /><h5>How about a favourite scene?</h5><br /><br />This is probably the scene in BLOOD CAPTAIN in which Stukeley returns to Ma Kettle&rsquo;s Tavern. I like its intensity and the way it captures Stukeley&rsquo;s conflict about what he&rsquo;s become. Another definite favourite would be a scene very close to the end of IMMORTAL WAR involving Lola, Sidorio and a lot of blood. I shouldn&rsquo;t say more than that but it really makes me smile! <br /><br /><h5>How do you feel about finishing off the series and saying goodbye to your characters? Was it an emotional time for you? Is it hard to walk away from the series?</h5><br /><br />It is emotional. I&rsquo;m writing these answers on publication day itself and I woke up feeling strangely emotional today. IMMORTAL WAR was a tough book to write because it was about saying goodbye. I think it has a certain elegiac quality and there are lots of references to clocks and time ticking away. Yes, I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving these characters behind, though I&rsquo;m not ruling out going back to them at some point in the future. I think that there are plenty of fresh stories waiting to be told. But at the same time, I&rsquo;ve been working on these books for the past eight or nine years, which is a big chunk of time in itself. I think it&rsquo;s important to create something completely fresh and frankly to show people that there is more to me as a writer than pirates and vampires. <br /><br /><h5>The first Vampirates book was published in 2005. Have you changed as an author over the past six years?</h5><br /><br />Yes, I think I have. I feel like my writing has matured a lot and, as I say, with each book I feel I&rsquo;ve been able to pull off things that I wouldn&rsquo;t have managed in the previous one. This is 90% good but it means that I sometimes wish I could go back into DEMONS or TIDE OF TERROR and rework things a bit &ndash; a Director&rsquo;s Cut if you like! I think I&rsquo;ve found a certain style and also a tone I&rsquo;m comfortable with. I suspect the books aged up slightly around BLOOD CAPTAIN and certainly from BLACK HEART on. This was not intentional &ndash; just about me finding my voice I think. <br /><br /><h5>What has been your personal high point over the past six years of Vampirates?</h5><br /><br />The things I&rsquo;ve loved most have been the writing itself and getting out and meeting readers, in this country and overseas. I particularly remember attending the Texas Librarians&rsquo; Conference in Houston and having a school librarian tell me how much her kids enjoyed the books. That gave me an amazing sense of how far, in every sense, the books have travelled. Equally, working with a bunch of Gifted and Talented kids at a school in Devon who helped me with a scene in EMPIRE OF NIGHT was really fun and satisfying. Just last week, I was talking to a mum who said that my books had started her son reading &ndash; that&rsquo;s a huge privilege to hear. And I can still remember the first event I did where the kids had read the book and suddenly I realised it didn&rsquo;t just exist in my head any more but now the story and characters were out there for sharing with others. That was, and always is, a magical feeling. <br /><br /><h5>I read a while ago about your plans to write Crossing Stories, the Vampirates &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; book. Is this still going to happen?</h5><br /><br />Well I&rsquo;m still under contract so I would think so! Seriously, I know how much my hardcore readers want to know Lorcan&rsquo;s crossing story and others too and I am equally excited about writing this down. I have some fresh ideas about this so watch this space! <br /><br /><h5>Do you have time to read many other books written for children and Young Adults? Any current favourites or authors we should be looking out for in 2011?</h5><br /><br />I&rsquo;m not as well read as I should be. When I&rsquo;m writing, I don&rsquo;t like to read other comparable fiction. Well, it&rsquo;s not so much that I don&rsquo;t like to but my mind can&rsquo;t seem to process it. So I have rather a lot of catching up to do whenever I finish a book. So I think you&rsquo;re better placed to advise me than vice-versa. <br /><br /><h5>If you could pose one question to any writer, living or deceased, who would the writer be and what question would you ask?</h5><br /><br />I&rsquo;d like to chat to Shakespeare and find out more about his process! Did he know just how good everything he wrote was and how easily did it come to him? <br /><br /><h5>If you were to host a dinner party for any three people (alive or from the past), who would those three people be?</h5><br /><br />Hmm, you said some of the questions would be fiendish and I think we&rsquo;ve now reached that juncture&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to plump for three of my favourite writers. F Scott Fitzgerald, Tim Winton and PD James. I imagine Fitzgerald would be quite a character. I have a feeling I&rsquo;d get on with Tim Winton, whose book CLOUDSTREET is a huge favourite of mine. And PD James is just a complete idol of mine. I love the fact that she is ninety and at the height of her writing powers. That&rsquo;s one of the most appealing sides of our profession. <br /><br /><h5>And if you were allowed to invite a few fictional characters as well?</h5><br /><br />I&rsquo;m going to be completely selfish and have a selection of VAMPIRATES characters, please. Sometimes it does feel like I&rsquo;ve been living in close proximity with them anyhow. <br /><br /><h5>What would you rather be, a vampire or a pirate and why?</h5><br /><br />A pirate, because I think &ndash; on the whole &ndash; it makes for a simpler and happier existence. <br /><br /><h5>What next for Justin Somper? Anything in the pipeline that you can tell us about?</h5><br /><br />Sure &ndash; if I kill you! Only joking. I am working on a new idea but it&rsquo;s too early to talk about or even know if it&rsquo;s going to work out. But I&rsquo;m excited about being back at the beginning of something and thinking up new settings and characters. No pirates or vampires in the next thing though. I think I can safely promise you that. <br /><br /><h5>Thank you for your time Justin. Is there anything else you would like to say to readers of The Book Zone?</h5><br /><br />Just that I hope you enjoy the books and if you have any further questions, come and chat on my blog at vampirates.co.uk or on twitter (@JustinSomper). Thanks for being part of this blog tour and for the valuable exposure you give to books for young people and boys especially.<br /><br /><h5>Huge thanks to Justin for taking the time to answer my questions. If you enjoyed reading his answers why not head on over to I Want To Read That tomorrow for the final stop off on Justin's tour.</h5><br /><br /><h2>Villains by Justin Somper</h2><br /><br /><h5>As a special additional date to his hugely successful blog tour, Vampirates author, Justin Somper, has battled his way deep into the caves to share his thoughts on bad guys with us.&nbsp;Immortal War is the fang-tastic finale to theVampirates series so, if you haven&rsquo;t already, sink your teeth into a copy today!</h5><br /><br />Firstly thanks to the Trapped by Monsters crew for inviting me to write a guest blog and making TBM the &ldquo;bonus extra date&rdquo; on my blog tour for VAMPIRATES: IMMORTAL WAR. I&rsquo;ve written a fair few blogs over the past couple of weeks but before I rest my (two) typing fingers (to clarify, I have a full set, I just don&rsquo;t use them for typing), there&rsquo;s one subject I&rsquo;m itching to talk about&hellip; villains.<br />As I take stock of the sequence as a whole, I realise that one of the things I&rsquo;ve liked best about working on this sequence is my cast of villains. They&rsquo;re just so much fun to spend time with &ndash; far more so, dare I say it, than the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo;.<br /><br />I guess my first uber-villain was Sidorio, the Vampirate who staged a rebellion in DEMONS OF THE OCEAN because he chose to take as much blood as he wanted, whenever he wanted. It&rsquo;s not an unreasonable demand from a vampire&rsquo;s perspective but it&rsquo;s enough to see him expelled from the Nocturne &ndash; the ship of benign Vampirates who take blood from donors at the weekly Feast Night.<br /><br />I never set out for Sidorio to be one of the sequence&rsquo;s leads but he&rsquo;s just been voted Number 1 in a blog list of favourite VAMPIRATES characters (for the full skinny, go to http://empire-of-books.blogspot.com/). Sid&rsquo;s really gone from strength to strength from one book to the next. In TIDE OF TERROR, he gets his own fledgling crew. On the whole, this doesn&rsquo;t go too well as he&rsquo;s none too blessed with leadership skills. But he does make a very significant sire when he brings Jez Stukeley back from the dead and makes him his second-in-command.<br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t intend for Stukeley to be a main character either (see a pattern, here?). In fact, I only brought him into the story in T-O-T to swiftly kill him off and demonstrate that I could deliver plenty of jeopardy! But Stukeley has lasted the distance of the sequence and he&rsquo;s possibly my favourite character of all. He&rsquo;s less of an obvious villain than Sidorio and I like the way he is often torn between his past life and pirate comrades and the new realm he is now part of. For me, this is best encapsulated in the third book,BLOOD CAPTAIN, when he returns to Ma Kettle&rsquo;s Tavern &ndash; but as a Vampirate, rather than a pirate &ndash; and all hell breaks loose. In fact, this is one of my favourite scenes in the sequence as a whole.<br /><br />BLOOD CAPTAIN also introduced another villain &ndash; Johnny Desperado, the cowboy Vampirate. Johnny had a bad rap with readers initially, probably because he sets himself up as a rival to Lorcan Furey for Grace Tempest&rsquo;s affections. I&rsquo;ve liked Johnny from the beginning but I think he&rsquo;s another character who has developed through the books. I think what helps mark him out is that whilst he is a very real villain, he can still be a great mate to Stukeley and have genuine feelings for Grace. That&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;ve learned about villains &ndash; they don&rsquo;t have to be villainous in every last thing they do. You can actually point up their nastiness by focusing also on their acts of kindness. Of course, it can also throw both reader and writer off the scent. In IMMORTAL WAR, Johnny surprised me by how nasty he can be. It seems even an author can be fooled by a character&rsquo;s charm!<br /><br />One of the most talked about villains in VAMPIRATES is Lady Lola Lockwood, who enters the sequence in BLACK HEART. What I like most about Lola is that she&rsquo;s terribly polite and sophisticated in certain ways but utterly vicious and bloodthirsty at the same time. She thinks it&rsquo;s uncouth to drink blood direct from a victim&rsquo;s flesh &ndash; she&rsquo;d far rather have the blood drained into wine bottles for drinking later at her leisure. She has shocking double standards. There&rsquo;s a fun bit in IMMORTAL WAR where her blood cellars have been vandalised and she cannot conceive of the brutality of people who would do such a thing!<br /><br />Lola does plenty of extraordinarily vicious things in the three VAMPIRATES books she features in and is responsible for a couple of the most memorable kills. I think she injected the sequence with a fresh energy and possibly a new, darker tone. I learned that you can ramp up the horror if you balance it with laughs and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Lola and Sidorio&rsquo;s scenes together &ndash; particularly when they are courting &ndash; are some of the funniest I&rsquo;ve written.<br /><br />Not all of my favourite villains make it to the last pages of IMMORTAL WAR and it&rsquo;s fair to say they were amongst the hardest characters for me to say goodbye to. As for the others, although the book says &ldquo;THE END&rdquo;, in my mind they will be busily getting on with their twisted plans long after the book is closed.<br /><br /><h5>As for me, it&rsquo;s time to get busy on writing something new. And it&rsquo;s time, I&rsquo;m sure, to get better acquainted with some new villains!<br /><br />Thanks again for the opportunity to guest post on the brilliant Trapped by Monsters and for being the last port of call on my blog tour. If you&rsquo;d like to chat further, do swing by www.vampirates.co.uk where I regularly talk to readers.</h5><br /><br />
