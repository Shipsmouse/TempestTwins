			<h1>Please Read City Of Fallen Angels FIRST</h1><br /><h2 class="center">Cassandra Clare writes The Infernal Devices and Mortal Instruments series of books.</h2><br /><h5>KatiebMundieMom:&nbsp; "Hi Everyone!!! We are so excited to be having a LIVE Spoiler chat with Cassie tonight. Our chat will be starting in about 30 mins.<br />Tonight's chat will be run differently than normal. Since we're excepting a large turn out tonight we have asked everyone to submit questions ahead of time. We'll be posting those questions first. If we have time at the end of the chat, we'll open it up for everyone to ask more questions during the chat. <br />We also won't be posting a lot of comments through out the chat, as we want to make sure everyone's questions are answered. <br />Please note SPOILERS will be discussed through out the entire chat. THANK YOU so much for joining us tonight and we're looking forward to having everyone on."</h5><br /><br /><br />Cassandra Clare:   Hi guys.<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Hi Cassie!!!!!<br />MundieMomSophie:   Hi Cassie!!!!!!!!	<br />KatiebMundieMom:   *Cassie can see all your Hi's* Sorry I'm not able to post them all.<br />Cassandra Clare:   Hi hi hi. :)<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Cassie- Thank you so much for being with us tonight! We are so excited to be talking COFA spoilers with you<br />Cassandra Clare:   I always like spoilers...<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   We do too! Here's our first questions<br />KatiebMundieMom:   When Alec listens to Magnus and Camille's conversation, is he doing that with some kind of rune that he put on the door or the wall of the Sanctuary?<br />Cassandra Clare:   Yeah, he's doing a little magical eavesdropping.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Just a reminder- we're not posting any questions asked during the chat unless we have time at the end. All questions being asked right now were already submitted prior to the chat.<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Angelica said...<br />How do you pronounce stele?<br />Cassandra Clare:   Stellay.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Valerie said...<br />Before CoFA came about, did you have another reason for Sabastian's body to disappear? Or was it always his "demon" mom who took it?<br />Cassandra Clare:   It was always his demon mom. I wouldn't have wasted an important demon like Lilith if I didn't want to see her again...<br />KatiebMundieMom:   She's so evil! lol<br />KatiebMundieMom:   but in an evil good way<br />Cassandra Clare:   In the scene where Clary sees Valentine get the demon blood to make Sebastian, he calls the demon "Lady of Edom" = Lilith.<br />	<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Bailey asked-<br />Well I have a couple questions first Why did you have to do this to me?!?!?!?! the cliffhanger thing drove me nuts and second If Jace wasn't a Shadowhunter what would he be and do you think it would be the same with him and Clary?<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Ohhhh I didn't pick up on that!<br />Cassandra Clare:   If Jace wasn't a Shadowhunter he wouldn't be Jace!<br />Cassandra Clare:   As for "How could you do that to me" the answer is so long that it's here:<br />http://cassandraclare.livejournal.com/53862.html#cutid1 (#1)<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Zoe asks<br />Why was it that in COFA, Lilith was very the lead evil-person, and we have heard nothing of her before? (I know the mortal instruments world was focusing on valentine, but you would think that since she was such a major role anyways (considering that she turned Sebastien part-demon), that she would be more influential, or appear more...?)<br />I also wanted to say that I just ADORED COFA so much!!!! Reading about Simon was possibly the best. I cannot wait to read COLS!!!!! :)<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Why was it that in COFA, Lilith was very the lead evil-person, and we have heard nothing of her before? " We have. She appeared in City of Glass. :) She was just called The Lady of Edom.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Ellie asks-<br />Hi Cassie! I know that with writing it's sometimes hard to control where your own characters go...so I was wondering which character, for lack of better phrasing, spiralled the most out of your control? LOL Like, who changed the most/had a much bigger role from what you'd originally intended, and by how much?<br />In any case, I love all your characters. Especially, of course, Jace.<br />Cassandra Clare:   Elli: I don't really know. They mostly stay within my control. Some get bigger roles than originally intended, like Magnus.<br />EllieEllie:  thanks for answering my question Cassie :D<br /><br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Katie asks-<br />Hi Cassie! I love your books and CoFA wasn't an exception:D There's been a question I've been meaning to ask since I finished CoFA and now I have the chance! What did the Silent Brothers mean when they said/thought 'Old ties exist between the Herondales and the Brothers. We owe him help' Has that something to do with Will? Anyways, you're the best;)<br />Cassandra Clare:   "'Old ties exist between the Herondales and the Brothers. We owe him help' Has that something to do with Will? Anyways, you're the best;) " Well, it's to do with the Herondales of Will's generation.<br />	<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Mella asks-<br />I'm afraid that what you wrote at the last page means that Jace will or has forgotten Clary completely,you said:"her image receded,vanishing imploringly...and the shadows closed over her and she was gone." Does that mean he will run of with Sebastion and start a scandalous relationship? (= Or does it mean that he can still fight it but hasn't forgotten Clary and still loves her?I mean just because of their crazy bloodmingle someone can't possibly simply FORGET to love someone right?<br />Cassandra Clare:   *giggles at the thought of Jace and Sebastian in a scandalous relationship* Jace doesn't forget Clary.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Tamara asks-<br />Hey Cassandra :)<br />My question: When you were writing CoFA, did you let your emotions influence the ending and all,or did you have a strict ending planned, if you know what I mean?	<br />Cassandra Clare:   Tamara: I had a strict ending planned. I knew this was where everything was tending. And I was very much looking forward to getting Sebastian back. :D<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Emma asks-<br />Hi Cassie! Love your books and ADORE Jace!<br />My question is...Since Simon drank Sebastian's blood and now Lilith's blood is in him, does Simon have some persuasion over Jace like Sebastian does? Will there be a chance that Simon can actually help Jace? Thanks for your amazing series! Best to you!<br />Cassandra Clare:   Simon doesn't have any persuasion over Jace.<br />Cassandra Clare:   That doesn't mean Simon can't help Jace in some way, or no one can. But no one holds any sway over Jace any more but Sebastian.<br />MundieMomSophie:   I loved how you brought back Sebastian...I have to admit. It was brilliant. Totally didn't see it coming...<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Booklover Book Chicks asks-<br />I need to know... is Will gay? Because in chapter 15 in City of Fallen Angels Magnus tells Alec and I quote "My relationship with you is nothing like the one I had with Will." So please help me, because I'm a little confused.<br />Cassandra Clare:   Well, if Magnus' relationship with Alec is nothing like his relationship with Will, wouldn't that indicate Will's not gay?<br />SashaSasha:  Why does everyone assume Will is gay? He loves Tessa!<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Why does everyone assume Will is gay?" Because camille uses the idea of him to make Alec jealous.<br />VaniaVania:  Jealous alec was funny. "ALEXANDER!" hee hee	<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Vania- LOL I loved that scene! It made me laugh out<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Karla asks-<br />What color are Zachariah's eyes?<br />If you could ask this one too: When did Zachariaj become a Silent Brother?<br />I have some crazy theories, and I'm not the only one, 'cause we love conspirator theories in the Official Spanish Forum.<br />Cassandra Clare:   Zachariah? He has dark hair, dark eyes. The less mutilated Silent Brothers tend to be made more recently. :)<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Bianca asks-<br />why did Jace's skin heal so fast after Clary cut it to damage the rune. Did it have something to do with Sebastian being so close to him?<br />You are my idol,<br />Cassandra Clare:   The rune on Jace's chest healed (gradually) because it wasn't one of the Gray Book runes, and it was under Lilith's control &mdash; when she died, it become under Sebastian's control. And now, so is Jace.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Juan from Geeks and Books asks-<br />Hey, I love your books so much! City of Fallen Angels was one of the best in the series, only City of Glass got the big trophy! Haha<br />If Simon hadn't become a Daylighter, do you think ANY of those things would have happened after City of Ashes? Or was that the changing point of the whole story? I mean, Raphael, or Camille, or even Lilith wouldn't have had such interest on him, and on killing him, if it wasn't for that, would they?<br />Just wanted to know what you thought about it! I know it seems to be three questions, but it's actually just one, divided up into three! Haha	<br />Cassandra Clare:   "If Simon hadn't become a Daylighter, do you think ANY of those things would have happened after City of Ashes?" Well, SOME of them would. But it's a bit like asking why is your cat your cat and not some other cat. Stories depend on all their independent parts to make a conclusion.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Raquel asks-<br />Hi Cassandra! You already know how much we love you, so let's get to the point. Please, please, choose one of these questions:<br />How did Magnus Bane and Catarina Loss meet each other?<br />How long has Catarina known Magnus?<br />Please Cassandra, never ever quit writing books! Greetings from Spain,<br />Cassandra Clare:   "How long has Catarina known Magnus?" Gosh, Caterina. I would say about 200 years.<br />FeliciaFelicia: Who's Catarina?<br />Cassandra Clare:   *eyes Felicia* You better not be in here without having read COFA!<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Claudia asks-<br />hi Cassandra! I cant belive that ending!!!! i cant belive you did that to us!! omg ahhh! I just want to know if now Jace is going to turn bad and like Sebastian or something like that?? and will he forget about clary? I really hope not! I love Jace!!! btw amazing book loved it!!!!!!! my favorite so far! cant wait for CoLS!! U are and amazing writer! love ya!! -claudia<br />KatiebMundieMom:   *sorry my bad, that question was already answered*<br />Cassandra Clare:   "I just want to know if now Jace is going to turn bad and like Sebastian or something like that?? " Well, it isn't going to make him good! He remains however in love with Clary. (And not in some weird way where he wants to kill her but he loves her. He doesn't want to kill her,)<br />	<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Carina asks-<br />What rune did Jace draw on Clary before she fainted on page 306?<br />I didn't know that there was any particularly "bad" runes, on account that runes are angelic aren't they? Or am I wrong?<br />Or am I asking to many questions..? haha<br />Well, love you're writing. I became such a YA book worm after reading your books :]<br />Cassandra Clare:   "What rune did Jace draw on Clary before she fainted on page 306?<br />I didn't know that there was any particularly "bad" runes, on account that runes are angelic aren't they?"<br />Sure, but there are still runes for things like "sudden sleep" &mdash; imagine if you might need them in battle because you needed to knock out someone in pain.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Justascrewup2 asks-<br />At the beginning of CoLS, will the clace know what has happened to Jace and Sebastian - that Jace is being controlled and that Sebastian has been brought back to life?<br />So glad that there are new Mortal Instrument Books! You've really taken it up a notch with CoFA. Looking forward to seeing what you do in future books :)<br />Cassandra Clare:   "At the beginning of CoLS, will the clace know what has happened to Jace and Sebastian - that Jace is being controlled and that Sebastian has been brought back to life?" No. No one has any idea where Jace and/or Sebastian are.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Lisa asks-<br />Hi Cassandra,<br />I really enjoyed reading cofa,you really bring your characters to life when you write. I wanted to ask you if Clary had the ritual by the silent brothers when she was born, and if not why wasn't Clary's mind affected in the way that Jace was? I also wanted to tell you that the scene where Simon tells his mother he's a vampire broke my heart. Will you revisit simon and his mother's relationship in future books?<br />Thank you<br />Cassandra Clare:   "I wanted to ask you if Clary had the ritual by the silent brothers when she was born, and if not why wasn't Clary's mind affected in the way that Jace was?" Because Clary did get something that protected her, and in fact, it ties in with ID. As for Simon and his mom, Simon has to reconnect with his family in general.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Dominique asks-<br />Hey Cassie! In 'Sanctuary' when Jace cut Clary was he actually momentarily possessed by Lilith, did he really intend to hurt her, or was he kind of...reenacting his nightmare?<br />I'm sure someone has asked about this and may be an utterly stupid question; but when Sebastian and Jace's blood intermixes in the ritual at the very end of the book; will Sebastian's 'powers' that emulate even Jace's(supernatural strength, speed etc.)be transferred to Jace -- enabling Jace to do all those things?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Sebastian and Jace's blood intermixes in the ritual at the very end of the book; will Sebastian's 'powers' that emulate even Jace's(supernatural strength, speed etc.)be transferred to Jace -- enabling Jace to do all those things?" Too spoilery! Sorry!<br /><br />Cassandra Clare:   Thanks!<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Maria Fancisca asks-<br />A few days ago on twitter was discussed about sex scenes in books, especially in TMI. My opinion was that not all the pleasure in reading is to read sex scenes. The sensuality may be at a look, a touch and through your books, we can see that Jace and Clary they have moments of sensuality that way.<br />However we can see that in the story is told about the sexual condition of certain characters (Magnus and Alec).Personally this is the first time I read about a homosexual romance, and thank you for writing it in a context so subtle, respectful and warm to read My question is regarding this topic... Do you think that society is really prepared to not discriminate against gays? ... and what was the motivate you to write a relationship love, starring a couple homsexual?<br />I'm reading #CoFA very slow, cuz I read and translates at the same time =P (I'm from Chile). I really admire you, and thanks for sharing your talent with us.<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Do you think that society is really prepared to not discriminate against gays? ... " No, I don't think that, but this is a large question, somewhat beyond my scope! I think we are making lots of progress, but since people keep voting down marriage equality obvs. not enough.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Lindseyy93 asks-<br />Will Jace be cruel to Clary now that he's part Evil Jonathan too? Will he have any power over himself at all or will Jonathan just like suck the life out of him...???<br />Cassandra Clare:   "and what was the motivate you to write a relationship love, starring a couple homsexual?"" Because I think fiction should reflect reality - especially fantasy fiction - and I wanted to write about a character who was gay, but the book wasn't about him being gay, he just happens to be gay. It's part of who he is but not the whole part.<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Will Jace be cruel to Clary now that he's part Evil Jonathan too?" No, not really. "Will he have any power over himself at all or will Jonathan just like suck the life out of him...?" Neither. He quite enjoys being evil, really.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Amanda W asks<br />Did Clary receive these protections at birth like the shadowhunters?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Did Clary receive these protections at birth like the shadowhunters? " &mdash; I answered this already &mdash; but yes, she's protected.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   LuckySparrowJewelry asks-<br />What was Camille going to tell Alec before they were interrupted by Isabelle near the end of the book?<br />Are there any outtakes that you'll be posting for us to read?<br />assandra Clare:   "What was Camille going to tell Alec before they were interrupted by Isabelle near the end of the book?" You'll find out in COLS.<br />"Are there any outtakes that you'll be posting for us to read?" I'll do what I can with deleted scenes, etc.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Question from Shelly-<br />Will we learn more about the "old ties" between the Silent Bros. and the Herondales as referenece by the "younger" Silent Bros.?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Will we learn more about the "old ties" between the Silent Bros. and the Herondales as referenece by the "younger" Silent Bros.? " Yes.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Anonymous asks-<br />Why was the release date for CP extended to Dec?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Why was the release date for CP extended to Dec?" That's the last question answered here:<br />http://cassandraclare.livejournal.com/53862.html#cutid1<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Anonymous asks-<br />This is so cool! Loved the book!<br />My question is: I remember Cassie saying that one of the circle betraying them, or someone betraying Clary and Jace and the whole crew (it's also on the goodreads page for COFA- it mentions a betrayal). Will that come up in the other books, because there wasn't really a betrayal as such in COFA! Hope it makes sense, and hope you can answer my question! AAAAAATGH! LOVE THE BOOKS SO MUCH!!! XD<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Cassie saying that one of the circle betraying them, or someone betraying Clary and Jace and the whole crew (it's also on the goodreads page for COFA- it mentions a betrayal). " I'm actually not sure if I said that or it's the cover copy my publisher wrote, but they mean Jace.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Cat from Germany asks-<br />On page 414 Magnus and Alec discuss Magnus falling in love again after Alec has died. Magnus then replies "There isn't going to be a next time". Could his response be related to their discussion of the Book of the White at the party? Magnus doesn't want Alec to become immortal (because he knows how painful it would be for Alec to watch everyone he loves die) and Magnus is in fact searching for a spell that turns him mortal (maybe with Tessa's help)?<br />If you can't answer the question, I'd really appreciate a hint. Thank you!<br />Looking forward to seeing you when you're touring in Germany; I'm going to bring a mango! ;)<br />And thank you so much for really being there for your fans and taking your time to answer all of our questions!<br />Lots of love and virtuals hugs from Germany!<br />Cassandra Clare:   Ah, someone brought me a mango in Portland. I guess the question is, do you think Magnus would turn mortal for Alec? Would Alec want him to? Would that even guarantee a "no next time"?<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Riema asks-<br />Hi, Cassie! I absolutely love you for always answering fan questions! Hope to see you in Germany soon :)<br />Who told Camille about Simon and his mark? Was it someone we know? Or someone we will get to know in the Infernal Devices?<br />Kisses,<br />Cassandra Clare:   Oh, Camille has all sorts of underground connections. Remember all Raphael's clan saw Simon's mark in COG. It would just take one of them to tell her<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Alexandria asks-<br />Will the rune Jace drew on Clary come into play later? Because I just don't see the point it why he did it when he could have taken her by force. I know real Jace wouldn't have done that to her but it was the bad Jace, right? Or is that wrong?<br />Thanks! :)<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Will the rune Jace drew on Clary come into play later? Because I just don't see the point it why he did it when he could have taken her by force." Dragging her kicking and screaming off the patio would have been a much bigger pain than knocking her out.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Amy asks-<br />I was just wondering what was the hardest thing to write in CoFA?	<br />Cassandra Clare:   "I was just wondering what was the hardest thing to write in CoFA?" The dead babies. Euurgh.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   CarolineK13 asks-<br />Am I right to assume that during this time alot of the same is happening between Jace and Clary? Like the distance and stuff? Or is something else going on with them?<br />Thanks for doing this chat!!! Your books are truly amazing!<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Am I right to assume that during this time alot of the same is happening between Jace and Clary? Like the distance and stuff? Or is something else going on with them? " Okay, confused, during what time?<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   anonymous asks-<br />Hey Cassie! Cofa was AMAZING! Possibly my favourite of the series.<br />My question is: Why the title 'Fallen Angels'?<br />Because I get Bones, Ashes, and Glass. But I don't really see how Fallen Angels connects.<br />Thank you! Can't Wait for Lost Souls!<br />Cassandra Clare:   The title: It's metaphorical. The tagline for the book was "Who will be tempted by darkness?" and the book is about temptation and falling prey to darker impulses. Simon falls when he bites Maureen; Alec when he frees Camille; Clary when she raises the dead; and Jace, of course, most spectacularly of all. We all fall from grace, is the message.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   nohoo211xma asks-<br />When Clary & Jace visit the Silent Bros to establish whether Jace is under a demonic influence, Bros Zachariah steps forward and says if he had been there the last time Jace was there he would have known that Jace had died & been brought back. Clary describes Bros Z as being young (his hands) with a single rune on his face, and no disfigurement....have we met him before in a previous book, before he became a Silent Bros?<br />Cassandra Clare:   *laughs* I am going to leave Brother Zachariah a mystery &mdash; but he does show up again in COLS.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Moujunir Lewis asks-<br />Hello Ms. Clare. I just wanted to ask: What made you decide to write City of Fallen Angels, and continue the TMI series?<br />Cassandra Clare:   I'm going to cut/paste here: I had indeed initially planned not to write more Mortal Instruments books after City of Glass. Two things happened to change that: One, I had written a plot for a graphic novel about what would happen to Simon after the events of Glass. When the graphic novel didn&rsquo;t work out, I was left with this storyline and nothing to do with it &mdash; it wasn&rsquo;t enough for a whole book on its own. However, while I was writing the first book in The Infernal Devices, Clockwork Angel, which deals with Jace, Clary, and the Lightwoods&rsquo; ancestors, the way events played out in it gave me the idea for a new villain and conflict that might beset the cast of characters from The Mortal Instruments, and connect up to the plotline from the planned graphic novel. I&rsquo;ve always liked stories where the distant past comes forward to affect the future, so, without being spoilery, when I realized I could connect the events of Infernal Devices to the few loose ends left at the end of Glass, I realized I wouldn&rsquo;t want to pass up writing that story, especially considering how much chaos I knew it would bring to the lives of Jace, Clary, Simon, Alec, Magnus, Isabelle and the rest!<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Mel asks-<br />Everyone always asks about Clary and Jace's streamy scenes, but will Simon ever have one as in depth as theirs?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Everyone always asks about Clary and Jace's streamy scenes, but will Simon ever have one as in depth as theirs?" Ha! Actually he has a pretty steamy scene in COLS. But he's a vampire &mdash; his steamy scenes involving biting.<br />VaniaVania: SImon sexy scene! Oh my Cassie you make my heart all a flutter<br />	<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Bethany asks-<br />What gave you the idea to bring Jordan back? Did you always plan it? :) Love the books!<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Anonymous asks- (we're dying to know this too)<br />Cassandra Clare:   "What gave you the idea to bring Jordan back? Did you always plan it? :) Love the books! "<br />I decided I wanted him back when I wrote the Simon graphic novel. He was always going to be Simon's roommate. The whole story got completely rewritten but that part stayed.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Why is Magnus banned from Peru?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Why is Magnus banned from Peru?" I cannot tell you, but it had to do with a llama.<br />KatiebMundieMom:   *snort* a llama...<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Andreina asks<br />I wonder if Isabelle's finnally settle down and give it a try to Simon, after the things she said to him about her parents. I noticed that probably she wants to fall in love with someone seeing her brothers already did. Would she try it again, but this time like exclusively dating?<br />I totally love the book, and can't wait to read City of Lost Souls.<br />Greetings from Venezuela.<br />Cassandra Clare:   "I wonder if Isabelle's finnally settle down and give it a try to Simon, after the things she said to him about her parents. I noticed that probably she wants to fall in love with someone seeing her brothers already did. Would she try it again, but this time like exclusively dating?"<br />I think Isabelle is very happy single. That said, she might be persuaded to give serious dating a try for the right guy.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Kayla Marie asks-<br />Who is going to be Clary's Rune teacher? Will she ever get one? Does the clave know about her angel blood?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Who was going to be Clary's Rune teacher?" Brother Zachariah. "Will she ever get one? Does the clave know about her angel blood?" Well, Clary rarely sticks around long enough to get taught. And yes, they do by COLS know all about her angel blood and her raising Jace, etc.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Emily asks-<br />Are there any other places that Alec and Magnus visited on their world travels? If so, are there any unmentioned humorous moments you could share? :)<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Are there any other places that Alec and Magnus visited on their world travels? If so, are there any unmentioned humorous moments you could share?" Well, after May 3rd, I'll put up the postcard story of their travels.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Hannah asks-<br />Who was your favorite person to write in COFA?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Who was your favorite person to write in COFA?" No favorites. Loved them all.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Questions-<br />Jen CarstairsJen Carstairs:  A question for the end of the chat: which sentence was more difficult to write: the opening or closing sentence?<br />KatiebMundieMom:   Thank you to everyone who submitted your questions before the chat. We asked most all of them. THe ones that didn't get asked were ones that didn't pertain to COFA. We're not asking a few that were on hold.<br />Cassandra Clare:   "which sentence was more difficult to write: the opening or closing sentence? " Opening. The end was pure fun, for me.<br /><br />NicoleNicole:  What was C&eacute;line's last name before she married Stephan ?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "What was C&eacute;line's last name before she married Stephan" I'd have to go look up the family trees &mdash; but it wasn't anything enormously relevant.<br /><br />Jennifer RayJennifer Ray:  Are the Morgansterns descendents of Jem. I was wondering because of the dark eyes and light hair.<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Are the Morgansterns descendents of Jem. I was wondering because of the dark eyes and light hair. " No,as Jem only has light hair because of the poison drug. His natural coloring is black hair and black eyes.<br />	<br />Brooke LewisBrooke Lewis:  Hey Cassie, will Maureens character be returing with a lager role in COLS or COHF?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Hey Cassie, will Maureens character be returing with a lager role in COLS or COHF? " we have not seen the last of her<br />		<br />Stacey (PageTurnersBlog):  Q if we have time: Why does Simon have arrows on his back on the cover of CoFA?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Q if we have time: Why does Simon have arrows on his back on the cover of CoFA? " Who knows? I assume a callback to his use of arrows in CoB.<br />	<br />ShadzShadz:  Will Luke and Jocelyn ever get married?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Will Luke and Jocelyn ever get married? " Well, let's hope so, but not until things are stable.<br /><br />MichelleMichelle:  Will you be releasing a book guide for both ID and TMI series?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Will you be releasing a book guide for both ID and TMI series? " Like a Codex? :)<br />	<br />SuzanneSuzanne:  Aren't all warlocks called Lilith's children? How come? They aren't all related to her are they?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Aren't all warlocks called Lilith's children? How come? They aren't all related to her are they?" Because the legend is that Lilith was banished to Edom and warlocks were born out of her drops of blood. It's not the case, but neither are werewolves literally the offspring off the Moon. :)<br />	<br />DiamondeDiamonde:  Will the Angel Raziel be making an apperance again in TMi or TID?<br />Cassandra Clare:   "Will the Angel Raziel be making an apperance again in TMi or TID? " He might. :D<br /><br />IrisIris:  Who started the Silent Brothers?	<br />Cassandra Clare:   Jonathan Shadowhunter started the Silent Brothers and the Iron Sisters.<br /><br />KatiebMundieMom:   Last question-	<br />FeliciaGFeliciaG:  Will there be a graphic series<br />Cassandra Clare:   There's going to be graphic novels of both series.<br />	<br />KatiebMundieMom:   THANK YOU to everyone on tonight.

At the end.<br />	<br />Juan RocaJuan Roca:  Thanks so much Cassandra! Love you and your books!
