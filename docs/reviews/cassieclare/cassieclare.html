I have a manuscript to read now...<br /><br />AND THAT'S ALL.<br /><br />SPOIL. RT @ismileforyou1: "Clary: have u been w/Jace lately? You still act like a couple?" I don't know where he is or even if he's alive...<br /><br />RT @Sydney_Walker: " Magnus, How much alike do you consider Jace and Will?" Not much at all. But few people knew the real Will.<br /><br />SPOIL@Rachel498: " Maia, would you ever consider getting back with Kyle in the future? Or is it too soon to tell?" Too soon.<br /><br />Magnus lives in 2007 and is unaware of the royal wedding.<br /><br />One more.<br /><br />RT @ismileforyou1: " jace: when do you plan on having sex with clary?" I'm not doing anything Saturday.<br /><br />RT @Salomesinece: " Gideon Lightwood, do you hate William?" No, not really. That's my brother.<br /><br />RT @Allycat1010: " Maryse even tho u dont approve of the Jace/Clary relationship do you like her?" She's a lot like her mother.<br /><br />You can ask the characters from ID if they love each other till the cows come home, but they won't tell you. :)<br /><br />RT @GardenOfLife: " Gabriel, are you close to Gideon? Any brother rivalries?" Gideon is a bit stuffy. But we are close as brothers are.<br /><br />RT @nova_scorpius: " Alec what are your thoughts about Will?" Wish I knew who the heck he was.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @Kika988: " Luke, as a father figure to Clary, do YOU approve of her relationship with Jace?" I did.<br /><br />SPOIL SPOIL SPOIL @AboutEllie: " Jace, are you returning to the Institute after what happened with Jonathan?" Oh, I'll be back all right.<br /><br />RT @Mariam0001: " Tessa: If Jem had feelings 4 you would you consider being with him? Or always love Will?" I don't love Will! I hate Will!<br /><br />@Shipsmouse Sure, a mother in law is one thing &mdash; but mother to the boy who's been dating your teen daughter for two months? :)<br /><br />SPOIL RT @HebelDesign: "Sophie: did you have hopes for Jem's love before Tessa came around?" I believe he has feelings for her . . .<br /><br />spoil RT @CharmingCat1987: "Jonathan, are you even capable of real human emotions?" How would I know? I feel only what I feel.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @Shipsmouse: " Jocelyn, what would it take for you to be a mother to any boyfriend Clary has?" Why would I be their mother?<br /><br />RT @MarleyGieseler: " Magnus, who do you think is hotter? Jace or Will?" Will.<br /><br />SPOIL SPOIL SPOIL RT @AboutEllie: " Jonathan, do you consider Lilith as your mother?" More than Jocelyn.<br /><br />RT @1josiecat1: "Jace, why is it you think you dont deserve clary?" I think I don't deserve to be happy&mdash;they're connected but not the same.<br /><br />SPOIL @twistedbrain1: Jonathan, do you ever miss Valentine?" He betrayed me. I no longer feel as I once did about my father.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @estrellina_: " Clary: do you now carry the Seelie Queen's bell with you at all times?" Yes.<br /><br />RT @AboutEllie: " Jonathan, do you care for Jace's feelings now?" Mostly he wants what I want.Minor exceptions to keep him happy are..minor.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @Bia_Lins_JC: " Jonathan/Sebastian, would you kill Clary, if you could?" Jace wouldn't like that.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @LSUJacq: " Jace: What are your feelings for Clary now that you're 'connected' to Sebastian?" I love her. I always will.<br /><br />RT @nova_scorpius: " Magnus, does the thought of Will still bother you?" Yes. I failed him . . .<br /><br />SPOIL RT @the_gigika: " Jocelyn, I figure you still don't approve Clary's relationship. Am I right?" Even less now.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @Sydney_Walker: " Jonathan/Sebastian, Why do you hate Jocelyn so much?" You have to ask? They hate me.<br /><br />RT @CullenSalvator: " Jace, can you see yourself with Clary forever?" Yes.<br /><br />RT @AudriannaLF: " Alec, do you want to spend forever with Magnus?" Isn't that what everyone wants?<br /><br />RT @_amyhewitson: " Jace you are hot and I think its about time you realised that you deserve Clary!" Hotness make you deserving?<br /><br />spoil RT @ColdOceanAve: " Simon, how did it feel when you had to take care of Jace?" An odd reversal. But he's not so bad.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @ninabeana42: " Maryse Lightwood, are you considering leaving Robert?" YES.<br /><br />RT @AboutEllie: " Camille, if Alec wasn't Magnus boyfriend, would you be interested in him?" No. Teenagers bore me.<br /><br />RT @revanche92: "Magnus, your style is always compared to Adam Lambert or Bill Kaulitz... do yo actually LIKE their styles?" Who?<br /><br />SPOIL RT @RaceCarHenna: " jace do you even realize what sebastion did to you that night on the roof?!" What?<br /><br />RT @coralakey: "Sophie, do you think Jem will return yr feelings, or have u accepted he doesn't feel that way?" I have sadly accepted it.<br /><br />RT @x3LifeLove: " sebastian how is it to be back?" Fantastic.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @beautededouleur: " Alec, are you going to try to find 'her' since you let her escape?" I plan to.<br /><br />RT @AboutEllie: " Magnus, have you ever met Dumbledore?" Dumbledore is fictional. :D<br /><br />RT @KatYBauuTiista: " Will: crees que jem alg&uacute;n d&iacute;a encuentre la cura para su enfermedad?" Will doesn't know.<br /><br />RT @AboutEllie: " Aline, did you ever have a boyfriend?" No. I just wasn't that interested.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @Salomesinece: " Jonathan, du you hate Jocelyn?" Yes.<br /><br />RT @GabyLafara: " Jem, why step aside?? you should fight for Tessa!!" So I can offer her two, three years before I die?<br /><br />SPOIL @JaceHIsAHotty: " Jace, do you think you will be strong enough to take your mind back from Sebastian?" I don't know what you mean.<br /><br />RT @smartylou: "Magnus, do you ever get tired of Alec being so emotional/dramatic?" Quite the opposite. He has the normal emotions of a human being, especially one so young - a big danger of immortality is losing your ability to feel. Being around Alec reminds me what it is to feel. @smartylou<br /><br />SPOIL: RT @nerd_for_life: " Jonathan: do you like Jace now?" Oh yes. He makes excellent company . . . now.<br /><br />RT @magnusbanes: " Jessie, have you ever had any feelings for Will?" Ughh. No.<br /><br />RT @Giuu_97: " Jem: Would you fight with Will for Tessa?" If he declared his interest, I would step aside, of course.<br /><br />RT @precociouspenny: " Jessamine: Will any eligible bachelor do, really?" Not a Shadowhunter is the main priority. And money.<br /><br />RT @22VELS: " Jace: Con cuantas chicas has salido antes de Clary?" I don't think he'd tell you that. :)<br /><br />RT @Lallie_O: " Alec, would you marry Magnus if he asked you?" Er.. it seems awfully early. Maybe we ought to live together first.<br /><br />RT @Salomesinece: " Will, will you ever open your heart for someone?" I don't think that would be a good idea.<br /><br />RT @AboutEllie: " Ragnor Fell: When are we ever meeting you?" Soon, very soon.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @twistedbrain1: "Jace, what's it like sharing headspace with Sebastian?" I don't know what you mean. We're 2 different people.<br /><br />RT @Manola_alex: " Jace, do you speak Russian by any chance...well like you speak Romanian?" No. A few words.<br /><br />RT @countrychik1031: " charlotte, are worried about losing the institute and who might take over?" It is a great concern.<br /><br />RT @Beatriix96: " Magnus, when and where did you born?" Batavia, 1640.<br /><br />RT @CharmingCat1987: "Magnus, who took care of your adorable cat while you were on vacation with Alec?" A warlock friend.<br /><br />RT @JaceHIsAHotty: "Tessa, do you believe there is still some good in Will, after what he said to you?" Yes. Maybe not enough.<br /><br />RT @sillyhay: "Jem : do you think Tessa&Will can be a happy couple?" If you can't be happy alone you can't be happy with someone else.<br /><br />SPOIL. RT @GabyLafara: "Clary, why did you leave Jace alone?" You could ask the same of Alec& Isabelle! We didn't think there was danger.<br /><br />RT @nova_scorpius: " Magnus, do you have any tattoos?" I might. Just of the decorative sort.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @the_gigika: " Alec and Magnus are you guys traveling again?" Are you kidding? We're not leaving New York till this is sorted out.<br /><br />Chairman Meow is just a cat, and can't really answer questions. He likes Alec okay.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @merielTLA: " Isabelle, now that Maia's out of the way, will u pursue a relationship with Simon?" Oh, the r-word gives me hives.<br /><br />RT @AEM87: "Magnus do you plan to tell Jace you knew his ancestor?" If it ever comes up.<br /><br />RT @CarinaOlsen: " Will:Are you jealous of Jem because of the way he feels for Tessa?" Jem's just nice to everyone, it's the way he is.<br /><br />RT @dapple_apple: " Church.. Are you on vacation? I missed you in CoFA." Church: bites you.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @andi3mari3: "Jonathan how did u LIVE when simon didnt give u blood shouldnt u need vampire blood?" Only to be a vampire.<br /><br />SPOIL RT @the_gigika: " Simon, are you planning to fix your relashionships?" I'm focused on fixing my relationships with my family.<br /><br />You can ask questions of the COFA characters and about COFA. I will tag SPOIL on the spoilery ones but those who have not read COFA might want to look away. Usually this process breaks my twitter account, so if I disappear, @reverieBR will tell you that I'm gone & The Q&A's over. I can't answer every question but I'll try to answer as many as I can. Address questions to characters, not me. And go.<br /><br />Okay, let me set up some rules &mdash; this is going to be SPOILERY.<br /><br />Okay... it's almost the end of April . . . I think it's time for a character interview....*flexes dying wrist*<br /><br />---<br /><br />We're done! Thanks for playing. :)<br /><br />SPOILERS RT @AboutEllie: "Max, who do you miss the most?" My mom.<br /><br />SPOILERS "Robert Lightwood, are you in Idris because you feel guilty about something...or someone??" Yes.<br /><br />Okay, Robert and Max left I guess but that's it!<br /><br />"Henry, what are you working on?" This little round twisty thing and when you twist it right it blows up. Good for exploding automatons.<br /><br />Always interesting to know what people are curious about!<br /><br />I think that's everyone.<br /><br />SPOILERS RT @amandaneblett: "Maryse, is your husbands affair the.reason you seem to be closed off/rude to everyone?" How rude, but yes.<br /><br />SPOILERS. RT @XPhile03: "Maureen, how are you adjusting to your new "life"?" I like it. I miss Simon. I'd like to see him... again.<br /><br />RT @smitth: " Gabriel, would you and your father run the institute?" It is what we would prefer. Charlotte is incompetent.<br /><br />RT @codysAminion: " Jocelyn would you ever consider having another child?" I don't plan on it but if it happened that would be all right.<br /><br />RT @rainy_days23: " Cecily, do you love Will?" I did.<br /><br />RT @WhoDatRachel: " Chairman Meow, when do you plan on taking over the world?" Meow. The Chairman's just a cat.<br /><br />RT @nameshill: " Charlotte, how's Henry these days?" Being mad in the crypt. The usual.<br /><br />SPOILERS RT @RockTheJoe: " Camille, would you ever consider getting back with Magnus?" Certainly.<br /><br />SPOILERS. "Luke, are you having 2nd thoughts about wedding w/ everything Jocelyn`s going thru?" It doesn't seem a good time for a wedding...<br /><br />"Jem, do you think Will is a wee bit crazed?" Will is quite mad, but he is my responsibility.<br /><br />"So Tessa, so do you have any plans on deciding who you enjoy more? is it Will or Jem?" I don't think either is interested!<br /><br />RT @xneritax: "Jem, which is your natural color hair?" It was black.<br /><br />SPOILER RT @Natz_JC: "Camille: Were you surprised to see Magnus is a relationship with a male?" No. Magnus has always been . . . flexible.<br /><br />BIG SPOILERS. RT @xneritax: " Maia, are you okay with Jordan? You could fall in love again?" Maybe. I really don't know. I'm confused.<br /><br />"Alec, if it's possible would you want to be immortal so you could be with Magnus forever?" Yes, if it didn't mean being a vamp.<br /><br />RT @TheSamanthaRae: " Eric: Can I be your new girlfriend?" Real-life Eric is married to my best friend so not sure I can give him away.<br /><br />RT @rainy_days23: "Magnus, if you could make Alec immortal, would you?" No, I wouldn't.<br /><br />"Seelie Queen, do you dislike Jace and Clary as a couple?"Like, dislike, so human. I simply find their love the best way to manipulate them.<br /><br />"Clary: is there anything you wouldn`t do to save Jace and ur love for eachother?" I'd like to think I wouldn't do something really evil.<br /><br />SPOILER If there is ever an relationship between Clary and Sebastian I may kill you." I had not thought of that but what an excellent idea.<br /><br />SPOILER RT @GabyLafara: "Simon, how do you feel about Izzy now? why didn't you kiss her?!" I thought she might punch me. It's a concern.<br /><br />RT @bookworm0510: "Jem wouldn't you rather be out living your life to the fullest." Jem: How am I not doing that? This is what I want to do.<br /><br />SPOILERS. MASSIVE SPOILERS. RT @LeesLuckyHat: "Kyle, will you ever forgive yourself for what you did to Maia?" No, never.<br /><br />SPOILERS "Jordan Kyle:Did you know we're totally in love with you now?" I knew this joining a band thing would work 4 me. Who are you again?<br /><br />SPOILERS. HUGE SPOILERS. RT @CreativityIsKey: " Sebastian- do you feel the need for revenge on Jace?" Not at all. We're good friends now.<br /><br />One question for each character! No more Will, Church, Jace, Izzy.<br /><br />RT @pixiedust515: "Iz: are you willing to give Simon a 2nd chance?" If he behaves himself.<br /><br />RT @MissChevusBooks: " Izzy, where do you buy your makeup?" Ricky's.<br /><br />SPOILER: RT @TMIexaminer: "Jace, did you not know about the protective runes/spells put on Shadowhunter babies?" Yes, I did, but I never &mdash; connected that to coming back from the dead." &mdash; Jace<br /><br />RT @Sarah_Beth_09: "Will, are you attracted to someone you don't think you should like?" Yes.<br /><br />RT @wwafflee: " Church, why weren't you in COFA? I miss you!" Asleep in the attic. I will return in the next volume.<br /><br />I'll take one question for each character. :) Then I'll do a real one when I am back from tour.<br /><br />"Are you going to do another character Q&A sometime in the near future?" How about a brief one now?<br /><br />---<br /><br />After COFA there will be NEW QUESTIONS. @MInstIDevIndo<br /><br />RT @GabyLafara: " you killed me with Jace writing poems to Clary." He doesn't write them personally, they're famous poems.<br /><br />RT @MInstIDevIndo: RT @JaceforClary: " will you do Q & A Again tomorrow? " God no. Maybe end of April.<br /><br />RT @tigresa555: " awwww church quit with the biting.." No, he bites Will a bunch in CP.<br /><br />RT @hollyblack: RT @nameshill: "Would Roiben date Izzy??" He may be a bad boyfriend in other ways, but he's loyal to Kaye.<br /><br />Church: bites you.<br /><br />Thankyouverymuchforplaying!<br /><br />Since everyone wants to know: Jace did not really sell all his underwear. And he wears boxers. Aaaaaaand that's it for questions!<br /><br />RT @J_meLove: Aline, how was it making out with Will??" methinks confusion abounds here<br /><br />RT @craftyhan: " Jem, are you proud of who you are?" Not with a foolish pride, I think &mdash; but neither am I ashamed.<br /><br />I did specify the question time period as being between CA and CP, and COG and COFA. @DorothyDonne<br /><br />RT @MaggiieBoop: " JACE: Do you like Latina girls?" I only love one girl. Now, if you'd gotten me last year..(Clary hits him upside the head)<br /><br />RT @MoNa_Winchester: " Tessa: Have you ever felt something more than friendship for Jem?" Jem? Oh, I don't think so.<br /><br />RT @arriearifa: " Will Herondale,, you always rude to everyone but Jem.. Why Jem?" Jem is different.<br /><br />RT @nadaraheem: " Jem, i found the cure!" Now that is just mean!<br /><br />RT @oldsargasso: " Aline, have you gotten a girlfriend yet?" Yes, her name is Helen.<br /><br />RT @Emmys322: " Jace: Can I have an autographed pair of your undies?" I've sold them all on ebay to buy Clary a pony.<br /><br />RT @arriearifa: " Gabriel Lighwood,, are you single?" Rather an improper question but yes.<br /><br />Okay, winding down. 5 more.<br /><br />RT @Lex_Weasley: " Jessamine: What's your opinion on Gabriel Lightwood?" Pretty green eyes, wasted on a Shadowhunter.<br /><br />RT @TessEdwards: " Jace: What did u first notice about Clary?" That red hair is hard to miss.Then the glare-girls don't usually glare at me.<br /><br />RT @MoNa_Winchester: " Simon: What was your first thought about the kiss of Clary & Jace in the Seelie Court?" Murderous rage.<br /><br />RT @arriearifa: " Camille,, have you ever dating someone after Magnus?" I've dated everyone after Magnus.<br /><br />RT @misspoco: " Jace, how tall are you?" About 5'11.
