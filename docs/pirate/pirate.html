			<h1>Pirate Definitions And General Pieces If Information.</h1><br /><p style="text-align:center;">These are in alphabetical order by the title.<br /><br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="scroll" src="files/scroll.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h2>Articles</h2><br />Pirate Captains had a strict code of conduct called articles. Below is a list of articles I have found. <br /><ul class="circle"><li>Penalty for desertion </li><li>Fair share of the treasure</li><li>Punishments for pirates that cheated </li><li>Gambling was banned </li><li>No lights at night </li><li>No boys or women allowed on board - Shall we ignore this one </li><li>Each pirate takes responsibility for maintaining his weapons </li><li>Equal voting rights </li><li>No fighting between pirates on board the ship </li><li>Compensation according to the severity of wounds </li><li>Musicians available to play when required </li></ul><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="cannon" src="files/cannon.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h2>Black Powder or Gunpowder</h2><br />Black Powder, Gun Powder, Lift Powder, Grain Powder, and Meal Powder are basically the same material, an explosive mixture of sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate or saltpeter. Because it burns rapidly producing lots of hot solids and gases, that can be used as a propellant, it is ideal for the cannons. But it won&rsquo;t burn effectively if it is wet, moist, or damp. <br /><br /><div class="image-right"><img class="imageStyle" alt="kegs" src="files/kegs.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h2>Casks</h2><br />Casks come in several sizes, here are the sizes I have found.<br /><ul class="circle"><li><span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; ">4&frac12; gallons	(about 17 litres)	= Pin</span></li><li><span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; ">  9 gallons	(about 34 litres)	= Firkin</span></li><li><span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; "> 18 gallons	(about 68 litres)	= Kilderkin</span></li><li><span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; "> 36 gallons	(about 136 litres)	= Barrel</span></li><li><span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; "> 45 gallons	(about 170⅓ litres)	= Hogshead</span></li><li><span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; "> 72 gallons	(about 272&frac12; litres)	= Puncheon</span></li><li><span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; ">108 gallons	(about 408&frac34; litres)	= Butt</span></li></ul><br /><div class="image-right"><img class="imageStyle" alt="black bart" src="files/blackbart.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h2>Famous Pirates, Privateers and Bounty Hunters</h2><br />Henry Avery, Samuel Bellamy, Stede Bonnet, Anne Bonny, Christopher Condent, William Dampier, Sir Francis Drake, Captain William Kidd, Jean Lafitte, Francois Lolonois, George Lowther, Godecke Michels, Henry Morgan, Jack Rackham, Bartholomew Roberts, Woodes Rogers, Cheng I Sao, Klaus St&ouml;rtebeker, Edward Teach (Black Beard), and Charles Vane.

It is thought the name comes the french joli rouge meaning pretty red. This was as the early pirate flags, which were hoisted before a battle, were blood red. They signified there would be no survivors. Later pirate captains designed their own flags, they were usually white on red or black backgrounds. Around the 17th century the white on black pirate flags come to be nicknamed Blackjacks and the skull and crossbones emblem was nicknamed the Jolly Roger. The flag was then used to warn victims to surrender without a fight. This tactic was very effective, lots of booty was gained without blood being shed. <br /><br /><h2>Julius Caesar</h2><br />Julius Caesar was kidnapped by Cilician pirates, in the Aegean Sea about 75 BC.  He was held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of Pharmacusa. He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. When the pirates thought to demand a ransom of twenty talents of gold, he insisted they ask for fifty. After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them in Pergamon. The governor of Asia refused to execute them as Caesar demanded, preferring to sell them as slaves, but Caesar returned to the coast and had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised to when in captivity &ndash; a promise the pirates had taken as a joke.<br /><br /><div class="image-right"><a href="http://mythbustersresults.com/special11" rel="external" title="http://mythbustersresults.com/special11"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mythbusters" src="files/mythbusters.jpg" width="39" height="37" /></a></div><h2>Mythbusters on the Discovery Channel</h2><br /><blockquote><p>"Pirates wore eyepatches to preserve night vision in one eye."<br/>"PLAUSIBLE"<br/>"This myth works under the assumption that the eye covered with the eyepatch is already accustomed to low light conditions, while the other eye must take time to accustom. The Mythbusters were sent into a dark room with light-accustomed eyes and were told to complete certain objectives. Their movements were hampered by the darkness and it took them five minutes to finish. When they went into a rearranged but equally dark room with an eye that was covered for thirty minutes, the Mythbusters were able to complete the test in a fraction of the time. As a control test, the Mythbusters then went back into the same exact room with light-accustomed eyes and ran into the same difficulty as the first test. The myth was deemed plausible because there is no recorded historical precedent for this myth." </p></blockquote><br /><br /><h2>Old Pirate Tradition</h2><br />The quote below is from Tide Of Terror by Justin Somper.<br /><blockquote><p>"But, more important than that, I wish you a life of love and laughter, friendship and adventure and not a minute of boredom."  She kissed her hand and rubbed it on his cheek.  "An old pirate tradition," she said, smiling.</p></blockquote><br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="rackham" src="files/rackham.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div><h2>Pirate</h2><br />The term Pirate was first used about when Jesus was born by the Greeks. It means 'attacker' and is used to describe any sailor who attacks ships or raids the coast. <br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="repairs" src="files/repairs.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h2>Repairs</h2><br />St Mary's Island, off Madagascar was an important place where pirates used to get their ships repaired. When a ship was beached, this was when pirates were most at risk of attack. <br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="kegs" src="files/kegs-2.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h2>Rum</h2><br />From Reeper on the Blue Peter Blog.<br /><blockquote><p>"I was watching something on pirates the other day, and it said why they were probably so keen on rum. Apparently its because it didn't go bad like water or all of their preserves. So it brought a question to me. How exactly does the Nocturne get their food? The Diablo stops at Ma Kettles a lot, so I can see how they do."Answer "Reeper, hi! Lots of great questions, as ever, from you. Good info about the rum. I've heard that too."</p></blockquote><br /><br /><h2>Scurvy</h2><br />Scurvy is a condition caused by a lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in the diet. Signs of scurvy include tiredness, muscle weakness, joint and muscle aches, a rash on the legs, and bleeding gums. In the past, scurvy was common among sailors and other people deprived of fresh fruits and vegetables for long periods of time. <br /><br />The quote below is from Demons of the Ocean by Justin Somper.<br /><blockquote><p>"What's that smell?" <br/>"Extract of Limes," Bart said, smiling.<br/>"Trying to ward off scurvy?" she said, with a grin. </p></blockquote><br /><br /><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="kegs" src="files/kegs-3.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div><h2>Small Beer</h2><br />Beer is good for your health, when drinking water may not be as safe as it could be.  In the days of the cholera and plague epidemics, it was noted that beer-drinkers did not fall ill. Monasteries through out the ages have been recorded producing beer for the local townspeople.  They were urged to drink beer instead of water owing to the poor water quality and this gave rise to a thriving brewing industry. Brewing of beer involves boiling the water first, which kills the germs and if the equipment is not sterilised, it is obvious as, the fermenting beer goes off.<br /><br />Even children drank beer out of fear of contracting cholera and typhus and sailors drank strong beer as it could be kept for months on the sea.  But as safe supplies of water developed, so did a taste for higher-alcohol beers, rather than the thirst-quenching, low-alcohol variety.  The first runnings from a brewer's mash (xxx) would go to a stronger beer, the second (xx) for ordinary beer. A small beer (x), taken from a third running, was probably about 2.5% alcohol by volume. Traditionally the third mash or small beer was served to servants, field workers, the poor, even the young.  Monasteries, in particular, produced large quantities of small beer in the Middle Ages.</p>
