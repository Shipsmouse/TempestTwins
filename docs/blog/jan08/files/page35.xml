Sally Tempest has some important and shocking news for Grace - the twins' real father is not the man who brought them up.

It was nice to see you again.<br /><br />In terms of publishing a list of my events, yes that is fine. Once vampirates.co.uk is relaunched, we'll have a much stronger NEWS section in which to mention such events in advance. Bear in mind that the Richmond Library one was primarily intended for their invitees plus a sprinkling of other locals, but I do take your general point about this.<br /><br />Any queries about foreign publication dates are best referred to me at the e-mail (see vampirates.co.uk) as I can check these out with the relevant rights people. This is not a service you need to offer!<br /><br />Re: DEMONS, what makes you think that Jamie is a vampire?! We'll be revisiting the kitchen setting in the new book, BLACK HEART.<br /><br />Re: DARCY, there's a fan online using her identity in a role-playing game, illustrated with a picture of silent-movie actress Clara Bow. I think that she would look like Clara Bow, or Louise Brooks or Zelda Fitzgerald, very much out of that flapper era.<br /><br />Re: LADY LOCKWOOD, yes in part she is inspired by "The Wicked Lady".  Indeed the fact that she is called Lockwood is in part a tribute to Margaret Lockwood who plays the part of the highwaywoman in the movie.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Justin Somper]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Richmond Lending Library</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2008-04-28T16:20:04+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/apr-2008#unique-entry-id-104</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/apr-2008#unique-entry-id-104</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/libraries/ypls_home/news_events.htm" rel="external" title="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/libraries/ypls_home/news_events.htm"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>The notice board at my son's (Powder Monkey Black William Flint) school had a notice on it that I think you may be interested in.<br /><br />"Richmond Upon Thames Libraries and The Lion & Unicorn Bookshop invite you to launch the National Year of Reading with Justin Somper author of the vampirate series.<br /><br />Kick off the National Year of Reading in style with Justin Somper, celebrated author of the Vampirates series.

Just tell me what you would like or send me a picture and I will make it black and white and a square.  As for pictures, all electronic artwork (and your photos) can go under the lookalikes pages.  So far I have Tempest Twins, Lorcan, Sidorio, Others Characters and Crew.  Unless you just want to do a range of black and white squares, then I can use them for crew pictures and comments.  To send them, just used the email address I answer your messages with.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You Tube</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Tempest Twins</category><dc:date>2008-04-10T09:55:25+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/apr-2008#unique-entry-id-99</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/apr-2008#unique-entry-id-99</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><a href="../../ideas/tv/trailers/trailers.html" rel="self" title="Trailers"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>The You Tube entries have now got their own page under the film and TV page.

In the days of the cholera and plague epidemics, it was noted that beer-drinkers did not fall ill. Monasteries through out the ages have been recorded producing beer for the local townspeople.  They were urged to drink beer instead of water owing to the poor water quality and this gave rise to a thriving brewing industry. Brewing of beer involves boiling the water first, which kills the germs and if the equipment is not sterilised, it is obvious as, the fermenting beer goes off.<br /><br />Even children drank beer out of fear of contracting cholera and typhus and sailors drank strong beer as it could be kept for months on the sea.  But as safe supplies of water developed, so did a taste for higher-alcohol beers, rather than the thirst-quenching, low-alcohol variety.  Traditionally the third mash or small beer was served to servants, field workers, the poor, even the young. The first runnings from a brewer's mash (xxx) would go to a stronger beer, the second (xx) for ordinary beer. A small beer (x), taken from a third running, was probably about 2.5% alcohol by volume. Monasteries, in particular, produced large quantities of small beer in the Middle Ages.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon in Canada</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2008-01-23T23:02:00+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-75</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-75</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Vampirates-6-Justin-Somper/dp/0316033251/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&s=gateway&qid=1201128804&sr=8-18" rel="external" title="Amazon.ca"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></a>I love the attitude of the Canadian version of Amazon.

So competition time, with three prizes this time.  First prize a signed Blood Captain, second prize a signed Dead Deep and third prize a postcard of Lorcan Furey.<br /><br />As before I am willing to put one entry into the tankard, per crew member, per page you have contributed on.<br /><br />Entries are only valid if I have a way of contacting you back, by a valid email address (or if agreed in the past via The Nocturn message centre). The page excluded from this, is the frappr map on the where page, as this is an external map shown on the Tempest Twins pages, which I have little control over.  For the crew page, if you have written about your character (ie it is in quote marks) it will be included as a contribution.  For the blog, you are welcome to send in contributions, I will post any I believe are relevant, any sent since the beginning of the year will be included as a contribution.<br /><br />Closing date is the 7th March so you should get the book by Easter, where ever in the world you are. I will email you if you are the winner asking for your name and address.<br /><h5>If you are under sixteen please get a parents or guardians permission before sending anything in to any website, especially pictures.</h5><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A little HTML</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Tempest Twins</category><dc:date>2008-01-14T05:48:25+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-73</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-73</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><a href="../../where/where.html" rel="self" title="Where Are You"><img class="imageStyle" alt="earth" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/earth.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></a></div>I learnt a little HTML on Saturday and now the Where page with the Frappr map is centred.

I saw part of the Pirate Special where they tested:<br />"Pirates wore eyepatches to preserve night vision in one eye.<br />PLAUSIBLE<br />This myth works under the assumption that the eye covered with the eyepatch is already accustomed to low light conditions, while the other eye must take time to accustom. The Mythbusters were sent into a dark room with light-accustomed eyes and were told to complete certain objectives. Their movements were hampered by the darkness and it took them five minutes to finish. When they went into a rearranged but equally dark room with an eye that was covered for thirty minutes, the Mythbusters were able to complete the test in a fraction of the time. As a control test, the Mythbusters then went back into the same exact room with light-accustomed eyes and ran into the same difficulty as the first test. The myth was deemed plausible because there is no recorded historical precedent for this myth."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Notorious Black Bart&#x27;s Daughter</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Tempest Twins</category><dc:date>2008-01-02T12:02:43+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-69</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-69</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="black bart" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/blackbart.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Message From Notorious Black Bart's Daughter<br />Just to say a very happy new year to all the buddy vampirates crew!!!!:-D]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Articles</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Pirates</category><dc:date>2008-01-01T10:23:19+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-68</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-68</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="scroll" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/scroll.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Pirate Captains had a strict code of conduct called articles.<br />Below is a list of articles I have found.<br /><br /><ul class="circle"><li>Penalty for desertion</li><li>Fair share of the treasure and punishments for pirates that cheated</li><li>Gambling was banned</li><li>No lights at night</li><li>No boys or women allowed on board - Shall we ignore this one</li><li>Each pirate takes responsibility for maintaining his weapons</li><li>Equal voting rights</li><li>No fighting between pirates on board the ship</li><li>Compensation according to the severity of wounds</li><li>Shares of the treasure</li><li>Musicians available to play when required</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vampirate Fans From Around The World.</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Tempest Twins</category><dc:date>2008-01-01T00:06:13+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-67</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/jan-2008#unique-entry-id-67</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><a href="../../where/where.html" rel="self" title="Where Are You"><img class="imageStyle" alt="earth" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan08/files/earth.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></a></div>Happy New Year to the Vampirate Fans around the World.<br />So far we have had hits from: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand (Aotearoa), Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Tonga, Tuvalu (Polynesian Island), Ukraine, United Kingdom and of course the United States (Commercial, Educational and at home).
