He is a great story teller and kept all the kids captivated.  It seemed to be based on his published books with him retelling them with names from kids from the audiance in a pantomine fashion.  My daughter loved it and so did the rest of the audience which went up as the layers of the theatre went to.  I am sure grade eight (or higher) were on the third floor (yes the TCU centre was full as the local schools got a good discount, so almost all school trips).<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Blog Entry</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2010-05-26T23:28:34+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan10/files/may-2010#unique-entry-id-334</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan10/files/may-2010#unique-entry-id-334</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan10/files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Justin has published a new blog entry.<br />Sorry just spotted it, this is when the message should have been written.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sixth Book title</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Books</category><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2010-06-03T23:27:31+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan10/jan10.php#unique-entry-id-333</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan10/jan10.php#unique-entry-id-333</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan10/files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Justin has published a new blog entry.

Across 9 seats, by my calculations we polled 0.34%, for a total of 1340 votes. Our best result was in Manchester Gorton, where our candidate Tim Dobson polled 236 votes for 0.62% of the vote.  Before this election, we didn't know what level of support we could expect. Nor did we know how to organise ourselves, or how to navigate the election requirements and comply with the law.

I imagine your events would be really fun, with people dressing as Vampirates etc&hellip; it could be a new Halloween costume <img class="imageStyle" alt="" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan10/files/page27_blog_entry314_2.gif" width="15" height="15" /><br /><br />Comment by Justin Somper &mdash; March 5, 2010 @ 6:42 pm<br />@ Jenny (Wondrous Reads) - Good to see you here! Thanks again for the lovely review of EON. You picked up on so many subtleties.<br />In terms of Vampirate props, I had some fun at the Cheltenham Book Festival last year, drinking &ldquo;blood&rdquo; from a glass tankard. It looked very realistic and I think it made some of the crowd a little nauseous. It was a Vampires vs Werewolves event so I had to come out fighting for the fangs!<br />After Halloween last year, I had loads of blog posts from Nocturnals who had dressed as my characters for the festivities. I think Lorcan and Lola were the most popular characters. Quite often when I visit schools, the students and staff dress up, which is fun.<br /><br />Comment by Freya Tarttelin &mdash; March 6, 2010 @ 6:34 am<br />&ldquo;In terms of Vampirate props, I had some fun at the Cheltenham Book Festival last year, drinking &ldquo;blood&rdquo; from a glass tankard.

Sadly the rest of the song goes into a major decline.<br /><br />By second choice was Welcome to the Jungle by Guns and Roses.  It was close but Jungle needed to be changed to Ocean, but the line "And when you're high you never Ever want to come down, Yeah" really described his reaction to unlimited blood.<br /><br />The other that I found that was close was Kings Of The Wild Frontier by Adam and the Ants.
