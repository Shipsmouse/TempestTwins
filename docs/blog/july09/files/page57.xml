Justin wrote in his blog "I&rsquo;m afraid that you will have to wait just a bit longer for it as it will now be published August 1st 2010.

Apparently Nintendo DS will soon be releasing the Flips range -- a new series on Nintendo DS designed to give children of all ages a fun new way to read their favourite books (including Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer).  Flips uses the DS touch screen and stylus to enable children to read and interact by combining the world of storytelling with quizzes and references to characters.<br /><br />So what does Eoin Colfer think "I'm over the moon to see my stories and characters brought to life on the Nintendo DS with the new FLIPS range.  Everyone knows that reading improves literacy skills. I have two children who are DS fanatics and cannot wait for the FLIPS to arrive, so EA might finally get them reading my books!"<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pictures Online.</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Books</category><category>Side Tracked</category><dc:date>2009-11-13T06:20:10+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july09/files/nov-2009#unique-entry-id-257</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july09/files/nov-2009#unique-entry-id-257</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><a href="../../ideas/lookalikes/online/online.html" rel="self" title="Online"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mouse" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july09/files/mouse.jpg" width="41" height="41" /></a></div>I have a virtual pet and have designed several habitats for him.

It is coming out on 12th November in the UK and I have already pre-ordered my copy (from Red House with it's exclusive letter from Anthony Horowitz) to be sent to my Mother-in-Law.  Incase I cannot find it in this part of the world or like Black Heart the hard back copy has not got neat edges.<br /><br />For everyone in the UK Anthony Horowitz is doing a bit of a tour.

I hope everyone who went enjoyed themselves.  It sounded like a brilliant festival with several good books and authors listed including Jeremy Strong and Terry Deary (Horrible Histories).  Syren (Septimus Heap book 5) by Angie Sage was also listed, it is out in the UK as far as I can tell, but due out in Canada (and probably America) on 29th September.  Dreadnought (H.I.V.E book 4) by Mark Walden thankfully was also listed, I had not realised it had been released in the UK as here they don't seem to have heard of book 3!  (Time to talk really nicely to my Mother-in-Law).<br /><br />Don't forget you can still see Justin Somper at the <a href="http://appledorebookfestival.co.uk/authorsandtickets.htm" rel="external" title="http://appledorebookfestival.co.uk/authorsandtickets.htm">Appledore Book Festival</a>, on Thursday 1st October 2009, from 7.00pm he will be at St. Mary&rsquo;s Primary School (&pound;3) and the <a href="http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/literature/" rel="external" title="http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/literature/">Cheltenham Festival of Literature</a>, on Saturday 17th October 2009 with Maggie Stiefvater.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Busy week</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2009-09-26T15:39:31+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july09/files/sep-2009#unique-entry-id-246</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july09/files/sep-2009#unique-entry-id-246</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.vampirates.co.uk/" rel="external" title="www.vampirates.co.uk"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july09/files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>Today (Saturday 26th September) from 5.00 to 5.45pm at Bath Central Library, Justin Somper will be doing his Vampirates show (&pound;4.50) as part of the <a href="http://www.bathkidslitfest.co.uk/default.php" rel="external" title="http://www.bathkidslitfest.co.uk/default.php">Bath Festival of Children's Literature</a>.
