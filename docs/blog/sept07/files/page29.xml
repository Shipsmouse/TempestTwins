It is thought the name comes the french joli rouge meaning pretty red.  This was as the early pirate flags, which were hoisted before a battle, were blood red.  They signified there would be no survivors.   Later pirate captains designed their own flags, they were usually white on red or black backgrounds.  Around the 17th century the white on black pirate flags come to be nicknamed Blackjacks and the skull and crossbones emblem was nicknamed the Jolly Roger.  The flag was then used to warn victims to surrender without a fight.  This tactic was very effective, lots of booty was gained without blood being shed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Competition Winner</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>TempestTwins</category><dc:date>2007-12-03T10:54:28+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/sept07/sept07.html#unique-entry-id-85</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/sept07/sept07.html#unique-entry-id-85</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="jolly roger" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/sept07/files/jollyroger.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>Our competition winner is Sailor Black Anne Read, Well done.
