I just want to reassure you of the following:<br />1.	The story comes to a natural end at the end of the book.  There are a couple of loose ends, but not the kind that keeps you up at night and nothing in life ever wraps up as neatly as everyone wishes.<br />2.	Moonshine finally grows up.  He takes part as a character, not as an upset, spoilt brat as he did at the beginning of the series.<br />3.	All the characters stay in character, they do not do anything that you have not seen glimpses of them do before.<br />4.	Lastly, I loved it.  By the end of the third chapter the two characters I was most worried about, I knew had made peace (and were together) after the events that happened at the end of Empire of Night.<br /><br />I do not believe I have the right to force my ideas on other people and so that is my review.  As written by an author on Twitter &ldquo;Never let anyone tell you what books are and aren't &ldquo;good for you&rdquo;. Read and think.&rdquo;  Loads of things in life other people have told me are terrible or brilliant and I have found the reverse.  So enjoy reading, do things expecting it to be a wonderful experience and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget the Captain has promised us Lorcan Furey&rsquo;s story will be written in Grace&rsquo;s book of crossing stories.  Which he is under contract to write after the series has finished.<br /></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-441" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title">Red House - Win Set of Signed Vampirates Books</h1><div class="blog-entry-date">Friday, 17 June 2011 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></div>Red house books have just relaunched their website and have added in a couple of competitions. &nbsp;One is winning signed Vampirates books.

It was all over an article on young adult books by the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://on.wsj.com/lVxoqs" rel="self">http://on.wsj.com/lVxoqs</a> which described young adult books as having explicit abuse, violence and depravity.  My Husband&rsquo;s comment was along the lines of &ldquo;oh they are doing it again, the Wall Street Journal always tries to show things in a bad light and only one side of the story.&rdquo;  I know from having kids there are three sides to every story, yours, mine and the truth.<br /><br />I read young adult books and I am not interested in reading about abuse and depravity.  The amount of violence contained in the books is comparable to 12A movies, and I do not hear them complaining about the movies.  The only difference between the 9 to 12 age books and the young adult books I read, is the more adult language used and under twelves are not so interested in relationships between couples.<br /><br />Why didn&rsquo;t the mother in the article just ask the shop assistant?  There are loads of wonderful books out there and all this article does is scare parents of teenagers.  With the world around us, do we really want to exclude relationships, gay characters and imagination? The most popular hash tag on twitter at the moment is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> as a reaction to this article.  I as a parent would prefer my children to read about experiences and the consequences and talk about them than to try something stupid.  The hash tag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> is where young adults are explaining that.<br /><br />Richard Kadrey is one of the many who wrote on twitter &ldquo;Did these adults never read when they were kids or have they, perhaps willfully, erased their own childhoods?&rdquo;  The author Cassandra Clare replied &ldquo;I think some adults do erase their own childhoods. And the ones who don't, read and write YA.&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Never let anyone tell you what books are and aren't &ldquo;good for you&rdquo;. Read and think.&rdquo;  Authors like <a href="http://twitter.com/maureenjohnson" rel="self">@maureenjohnson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cassieclare" rel="self">@cassieclare</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hollyblack" rel="self">@hollyblack</a> are asking their followers on Twitter &ldquo;Did YA help you? Let the world know how! Tell your story with a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> tag.

For anyone who does not know Comic Relief has announced the next Red Nose Day will be 18th March 2011 and one of the noses they have released is Captain Conk the pirate.  Every two years the UK comedians help raise money to help make a difference to peoples lives both in the UK and abroad (predominantly in Africa).  So for the &pound;1 spent to buy either a Captain Conk red nose from Sainsbury's or Captain Conk pen from Ryman's, half of the profits goes to UK and half to Africa.  (Just a note on the nose boxes it says "with at least 70p going to Comic Relief" and the pens have "Ryman will donate &pound;1 for each pen sold.")<br />Please see <a href="http://www.rednoseday.com/" rel="self" title="http://www.rednoseday.com/">http://www.rednoseday.com/</a> for more information.<br /><br />The second is from the United States with books.  I heard about it via Twitter<br />"RT @<a href="http://twitter.com/iEatWordsTweets" rel="self" title="http://twitter.com/iEatWordsTweets">iEatWordsTweets</a>: @<a href="http://twitter.com/cassieclare" rel="self" title="http://twitter.com/cassieclare">cassieclare</a> Hi Cassie!

Please see the article on the front of first news, <a href="http://www.firstnews.co.uk/news/schoolgirl-asks-david-cameron-to-save-our-libraries-i3532" rel="self" title="http://www.firstnews.co.uk/news/schoolgirl-asks-david-cameron-to-save-our-libraries-i3532">http://www.firstnews.co.uk/news/schoolgirl-asks-david-cameron-to-save-our-libraries-i3532</a> .   (I noticed Miss Trueman in the article is holding up the Lemonade War.  My son read this recently and loved it.)<br /><br />It made me realise in the two months I have been back in England I have been down the library twice.  First to get my card and second to use the internet.  I thought about why and realised the two local branches are not as accessible (to me) as they first look.  The first is in the local town, which when you can find a parking space near the library charges you 70p an hour.<br /><br />The second is in the local secondary school, I am not sure where.  My issue with that is; I get nervous the first couple of times going into a new school.  Yes I am an adult, yes I walk my kids into school every day, yes when my son was small I helped lesson to people in his class reading, yes I know reading is important and I should be encouraging my kids, but the truth is I think on my kids first day in their new schools I am more scared than them.  Having learning difficulties made school hard and Dyslexia was not understood 35 years ago as it is today.  I was labelled lazy and kept in at break times.  Going places like a strange school is scary especially alone so I have sub-continuously not planed to go to the library.<br /><br />But were I last lived the library was in the corner of the local sports centre and had free parking.  We visited as a family every two weeks.  They had a website and encouraged people to go via the website to select your books in advance, then collect them within a week from the hold shelf.  Thus encouraging people to read whole sets of books not just from the local branch but any book listed on the library catalogue.<br /><br />Also in my kids last schools, (one went to the school on the left and the other went to the school on the right), every autumn/fall term, every class made a trip to the local library and every child was expected to have their library card sent into school in advance (or a form completed to get one).<br /><br />Before that I lived in a village between two towns.  The kids used to walk to school (unlike here) and the local library was between two of the local schools.  So it was easy to take a slight detour home via the library.<br /><br />It is weird how, where somewhere is placed and social attitudes affects your habits.  So good luck with the save the libraries campaign.<br /><br /><h5>Comments Back</h5><br />As most people who travel by train regularly read, why don't libraries arrange collection from BR's coffee shops (after ordering online) and have return boxes inside the same shops.  Most stations have 15 minutes free parking outside too.<br /></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-385" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title">World Book Night in the UK</h1><div class="blog-entry-date">Friday, 21 January 2011 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></div>Saturday 5 March 2011 is World Book Night and one million books will be given away by an army of passionate readers to members of the public across the UK and Ireland.
