I just want to reassure you of the following:<br />1.	The story comes to a natural end at the end of the book.  There are a couple of loose ends, but not the kind that keeps you up at night and nothing in life ever wraps up as neatly as everyone wishes.<br />2.	Moonshine finally grows up.  He takes part as a character, not as an upset, spoilt brat as he did at the beginning of the series.<br />3.	All the characters stay in character, they do not do anything that you have not seen glimpses of them do before.<br />4.	Lastly, I loved it.  By the end of the third chapter the two characters I was most worried about, I knew had made peace (and were together) after the events that happened at the end of Empire of Night.<br /><br />I do not believe I have the right to force my ideas on other people and so that is my review.  As written by an author on Twitter &ldquo;Never let anyone tell you what books are and aren't &ldquo;good for you&rdquo;. Read and think.&rdquo;  Loads of things in life other people have told me are terrible or brilliant and I have found the reverse.  So enjoy reading, do things expecting it to be a wonderful experience and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget the Captain has promised us Lorcan Furey&rsquo;s story will be written in Grace&rsquo;s book of crossing stories.  Which he is under contract to write after the series has finished.<br /></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-445" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title">Newsround Hotseat</h1><div class="blog-entry-date">Wednesday, 22 June 2011 Filed in: <span class="blog-entry-category"><a href="category-justin-somper.php">Justin Somper</a></span></div><div class="blog-entry-body"><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>If you have a question for the Captain last week you could have either gone to the VIP section of <a href="http://www.vampirates.co.uk/" rel="self">www.vampirates.co.uk/</a> or to Newsround website, as the Captain was in the Hotseat last Friday.

It was all over an article on young adult books by the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://on.wsj.com/lVxoqs" rel="self">http://on.wsj.com/lVxoqs</a> which described young adult books as having explicit abuse, violence and depravity.  My Husband&rsquo;s comment was along the lines of &ldquo;oh they are doing it again, the Wall Street Journal always tries to show things in a bad light and only one side of the story.&rdquo;  I know from having kids there are three sides to every story, yours, mine and the truth.<br /><br />I read young adult books and I am not interested in reading about abuse and depravity.  The amount of violence contained in the books is comparable to 12A movies, and I do not hear them complaining about the movies.  The only difference between the 9 to 12 age books and the young adult books I read, is the more adult language used and under twelves are not so interested in relationships between couples.<br /><br />Why didn&rsquo;t the mother in the article just ask the shop assistant?  There are loads of wonderful books out there and all this article does is scare parents of teenagers.  With the world around us, do we really want to exclude relationships, gay characters and imagination? The most popular hash tag on twitter at the moment is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> as a reaction to this article.  I as a parent would prefer my children to read about experiences and the consequences and talk about them than to try something stupid.  The hash tag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> is where young adults are explaining that.<br /><br />Richard Kadrey is one of the many who wrote on twitter &ldquo;Did these adults never read when they were kids or have they, perhaps willfully, erased their own childhoods?&rdquo;  The author Cassandra Clare replied &ldquo;I think some adults do erase their own childhoods. And the ones who don't, read and write YA.&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Never let anyone tell you what books are and aren't &ldquo;good for you&rdquo;. Read and think.&rdquo;  Authors like <a href="http://twitter.com/maureenjohnson" rel="self">@maureenjohnson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cassieclare" rel="self">@cassieclare</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hollyblack" rel="self">@hollyblack</a> are asking their followers on Twitter &ldquo;Did YA help you? Let the world know how! Tell your story with a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> tag.
