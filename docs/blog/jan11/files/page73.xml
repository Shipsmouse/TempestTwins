The results have just been published on their website, so please go and check out <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_9510000/newsid_9510200/9510212.stm" rel="self">news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews</a><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Immortal War Review</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Books</category><dc:date>2011-06-26T12:12:18+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-444</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-444</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="mouse" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/mouse.jpg" width="41" height="41" /></div>I know many of you outside the UK are frustrated that you have to wait from six months to get your copies of the latest and last in the Vampirates series.  I just want to reassure you of the following:<br />1.	The story comes to a natural end at the end of the book.  There are a couple of loose ends, but not the kind that keeps you up at night and nothing in life ever wraps up as neatly as everyone wishes.<br />2.	Moonshine finally grows up.  He takes part as a character, not as an upset, spoilt brat as he did at the beginning of the series.<br />3.	All the characters stay in character, they do not do anything that you have not seen glimpses of them do before.<br />4.	Lastly, I loved it.  By the end of the third chapter the two characters I was most worried about, I knew had made peace (and were together) after the events that happened at the end of Empire of Night.<br /><br />I do not believe I have the right to force my ideas on other people and so that is my review.  As written by an author on Twitter &ldquo;Never let anyone tell you what books are and aren't &ldquo;good for you&rdquo;. Read and think.&rdquo;  Loads of things in life other people have told me are terrible or brilliant and I have found the reverse.  So enjoy reading, do things expecting it to be a wonderful experience and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget the Captain has promised us Lorcan Furey&rsquo;s story will be written in Grace&rsquo;s book of crossing stories.  Which he is under contract to write after the series has finished.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Penny Smith Chats to Justin Somper</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2011-06-18T05:32:03+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-443</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-443</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Sq_Rackham.jpg" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/Sq_Rackham.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>Radio 2 Arts Show: Penny Smith sits In at chats to Justin Somper at 1:30 / 2:00 - <a href="http://bbc.in/jJXMNY" rel="self">http://bbc.in/jJXMNY</a><br />This should be available abroad and in the UK until 12:02AM Sat, 25 Jun 2011 according to the website.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Autumn 2011</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Vampirates</category><dc:date>2011-06-17T14:38:12+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-442</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-442</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="jolly roger" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/jollyroger.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>From Twitter - @comgavrob gavin robertson<br />&ldquo;First dates and Autumn 2011 touring schedule for VAMPIRATES now up at - <a href="gavinrobertson.com/news.htm" rel="self">gavinrobertson.com/news.htm</a>&rdquo;<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Red House - Win Set of Signed Vampirates Books</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Books</category><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2011-06-17T12:22:53+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-441</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-441</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></div>Red house books have just relaunched their website and have added in a couple of competitions. &nbsp;One is winning signed Vampirates books.

It was all over an article on young adult books by the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://on.wsj.com/lVxoqs" rel="self">http://on.wsj.com/lVxoqs</a> which described young adult books as having explicit abuse, violence and depravity.  My Husband&rsquo;s comment was along the lines of &ldquo;oh they are doing it again, the Wall Street Journal always tries to show things in a bad light and only one side of the story.&rdquo;  I know from having kids there are three sides to every story, yours, mine and the truth.<br /><br />I read young adult books and I am not interested in reading about abuse and depravity.  The amount of violence contained in the books is comparable to 12A movies, and I do not hear them complaining about the movies.  The only difference between the 9 to 12 age books and the young adult books I read, is the more adult language used and under twelves are not so interested in relationships between couples.<br /><br />Why didn&rsquo;t the mother in the article just ask the shop assistant?  There are loads of wonderful books out there and all this article does is scare parents of teenagers.  With the world around us, do we really want to exclude relationships, gay characters and imagination? The most popular hash tag on twitter at the moment is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> as a reaction to this article.  I as a parent would prefer my children to read about experiences and the consequences and talk about them than to try something stupid.  The hash tag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> is where young adults are explaining that.<br /><br />Richard Kadrey is one of the many who wrote on twitter &ldquo;Did these adults never read when they were kids or have they, perhaps willfully, erased their own childhoods?&rdquo;  The author Cassandra Clare replied &ldquo;I think some adults do erase their own childhoods. And the ones who don't, read and write YA.&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Never let anyone tell you what books are and aren't &ldquo;good for you&rdquo;. Read and think.&rdquo;  Authors like <a href="http://twitter.com/maureenjohnson" rel="self">@maureenjohnson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cassieclare" rel="self">@cassieclare</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hollyblack" rel="self">@hollyblack</a> are asking their followers on Twitter &ldquo;Did YA help you? Let the world know how! Tell your story with a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23YAsaves" rel="self">#YAsaves</a> tag. And <a href="http://twitter.com/wsj" rel="self">@wsj</a>&rdquo;.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Win A Stack Of Books</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Books</category><dc:date>2011-06-03T10:47:17+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-416</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-416</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></div>For anyone in the UK, Red House books is giving away a child&rsquo;s height in books for visiting their new Facebook page.<br />Please See <a href="http://on.fb.me/lgX6r1" rel="self">http://on.fb.me/lgX6r1</a><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pirate Quiz</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Pirates</category><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2011-06-03T10:14:13+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-415</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/jan11.php#unique-entry-id-415</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="jolly roger" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/jollyroger.jpg" width="40" height="39" /></div>We are off to collect today&rsquo;s Times after reading this from @JustinSomper on twitter.<br />Check out a swashbuckling pirate quiz by yours truly in today's Times (Young Times).

Please see the article on the front of first news, <a href="http://www.firstnews.co.uk/news/schoolgirl-asks-david-cameron-to-save-our-libraries-i3532" rel="self" title="http://www.firstnews.co.uk/news/schoolgirl-asks-david-cameron-to-save-our-libraries-i3532">http://www.firstnews.co.uk/news/schoolgirl-asks-david-cameron-to-save-our-libraries-i3532</a> .   (I noticed Miss Trueman in the article is holding up the Lemonade War.  My son read this recently and loved it.)<br /><br />It made me realise in the two months I have been back in England I have been down the library twice.  First to get my card and second to use the internet.  I thought about why and realised the two local branches are not as accessible (to me) as they first look.  The first is in the local town, which when you can find a parking space near the library charges you 70p an hour.<br /><br />The second is in the local secondary school, I am not sure where.  My issue with that is; I get nervous the first couple of times going into a new school.  Yes I am an adult, yes I walk my kids into school every day, yes when my son was small I helped lesson to people in his class reading, yes I know reading is important and I should be encouraging my kids, but the truth is I think on my kids first day in their new schools I am more scared than them.  Having learning difficulties made school hard and Dyslexia was not understood 35 years ago as it is today.  I was labelled lazy and kept in at break times.  Going places like a strange school is scary especially alone so I have sub-continuously not planed to go to the library.<br /><br />But were I last lived the library was in the corner of the local sports centre and had free parking.  We visited as a family every two weeks.  They had a website and encouraged people to go via the website to select your books in advance, then collect them within a week from the hold shelf.  Thus encouraging people to read whole sets of books not just from the local branch but any book listed on the library catalogue.<br /><br />Also in my kids last schools, (one went to the school on the left and the other went to the school on the right), every autumn/fall term, every class made a trip to the local library and every child was expected to have their library card sent into school in advance (or a form completed to get one).<br /><br />Before that I lived in a village between two towns.  The kids used to walk to school (unlike here) and the local library was between two of the local schools.  So it was easy to take a slight detour home via the library.<br /><br />It is weird how, where somewhere is placed and social attitudes affects your habits.  So good luck with the save the libraries campaign.<br /><br /><h5>Comments Back</h5><br />As most people who travel by train regularly read, why don't libraries arrange collection from BR's coffee shops (after ordering online) and have return boxes inside the same shops.  Most stations have 15 minutes free parking outside too.<br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hornsey Library in Crouch End</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2011-02-01T11:53:58+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/feb-2011#unique-entry-id-387</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/feb-2011#unique-entry-id-387</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>Justin Somper wrote on twitter that "Next Saturday (Feb 5th) I'll be at Hornsey Library in Crouch End at 2:00 pm to chat and mark National Library Day.

As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve just signed a contract with a theatre company who are going to create a VAMPIRATES play to take into schools and festivals. I&rsquo;m excited to see what they come up with. Watch this space for more details on that."<br /><br />"I can&rsquo;t remember where I mentioned that Lorcan has a brother &ndash; possibly during one of my US tour events. But yes he does. His name is Cathal and he&rsquo;s involved in Lorcan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crossing Story&rdquo;."<br /><br />I always think of Ma Kettle&rsquo;s of being a combination of three places &ndash; the Rover&rsquo;s Return (from UK soap Coronation Street), the Moulin rouge (in Paris) and the Boar&rsquo;s Head Tavern (from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry 4th plays). It&rsquo;s a crazy, over-the-top kind of place that changes all the time so I&rsquo;d say just run with your imaginations.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>World Book Night in the UK</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Books</category><dc:date>2011-01-21T13:31:14+00:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/jan-2011#unique-entry-id-385</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/jan-2011#unique-entry-id-385</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/jan11/files/books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></div>Saturday 5 March 2011 is World Book Night and one million books will be given away by an army of passionate readers to members of the public across the UK and Ireland.
