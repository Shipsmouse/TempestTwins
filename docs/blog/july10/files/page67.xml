Usually the first one has more spoilers than the second. But here it is if you want to read it:<br /><br />A bloody war is raging across the oceans, with the Pirate Federation and Nocturnals in alliance against the renegade Vampirates, led by Sidorio and Lola. Lola might be heavily pregnant with twins, but it doesn\'t stop her from remaining an active presence in battles! Connor and Grace Tempest each have important roles to play in the war - he as a pirate warrior at the heart of the fight; she as a powerful healer working with the war-wounded. As the twins face their greatest challenges to date, old allies and foes return to play their part in the ultimate battle of Pirate versus Vampirate. <span style="font:12px Courier, mono; "><br /></span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Litteralund Book Festival&#x2c; Sweden</title><dc:creator>mice@mindless.com</dc:creator><category>Events</category><category>Justin Somper</category><dc:date>2010-10-11T02:18:40+01:00</dc:date><link>http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july10/files/oct-2010#unique-entry-id-371</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july10/files/oct-2010#unique-entry-id-371</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="http://www.tempesttwins.co.uk/blog/july10/files/vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></div>For those in Sweden Justin Somper is visiting the Litterlund Bokfestival F&ouml;r Barn Och Unga!

I adore the book and characters though my connection with Grace sometimes scares me... I guess you could also say Im a Grace look alike (brown wavy hair-greeeeeeen eyes and so forth) and honestly I dont think its an age thing at all for this book. I think its a book that is easily lovable for all ages even my dad and I fight over who gets to read the next book 1st. all I can say is if you havent read it you should and REALLY dont knock it to you try it.... Twilight fairly ruined peoples thoughts on vampires!"<br /><br />It is lovely having others write blog entries for me.

As this week is the week schools go back I do hope you all had a chance to relax over the summer.<br /><br />My summer was spent teaching my youngest to read.  Under <a href="../../who/who.html" rel="self" title="Who Am I ?">who am I</a>, you may have read that I am dyslexic and reading was a struggle at school.  I did not want to repeat my fear of words with my youngest.  It looks like we are returning from Canada to the UK during the autumn term, which effects my children as the UK are a year ahead of Canada.  So although my three foot high ninja will be starting kindergarten tomorrow morning, on touching down on British soil she will be expected to attend year 1.  I am impressed with her, in two months she can now <a href="../../who/reading/reading.html" rel="self" title="Reading">read</a> basic words and the occasional hard one and she proved tonight she can also tie her shoe laces.<br /><br />To everyone who is going back to school, I do hope you enjoy this term.
