I have found another good set to add to the list of recommendations.  But for a change this is a set of four books of short stories about two regular chapters long.<br /><br />An author called Ed Wicke (http://www.blacknbluepress.info/edhome.html) visited my daughters school.  The first time I saw him i was in the hall and he swept off this hat and bowed to the kids around me.  The kids loved it, the next time I saw him he was sitting outside school selling and signing some of his books.  We bought wicked tales four, or the purple one as my daughter calls it.  Last Friday he returned to sell and sign more, so we had to get the first three to complete the set.<br /><br />We loved wicked tales four, especially the page before the story starts on the voices, my daughter with her large brown eyes can do the kitten's look very well (she not a confident reader yet an so no voices).  When my husband read a story he could not stay in a Florida accent and so the pair of Gaiters were scouse in the end.<br /><br />So if the accents do not start the giggles going the stories and occasional picture will. I don't usually like baby stories but reading about a baby throwing toys out of a cot each one named (Ted the toy tractor) even had me in giggles.<br /><br />So if you are looking for short stories as funny as Jeremy Strong's please give Ed Wicke's Wicked Tales a go.<br /></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-487" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title">Audiobooks</h1><div class="blog-entry-date">Wednesday, 04 July 2012 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.vampirates.co.uk/" rel="external" title="www.vampirates.co.uk"><img class="imageStyle" alt="vampirates" src="vampirates.jpg" width="40" height="40" /></a></div>If you like listening to your stories there is good news on the horizon.

And I never want my books equated with the dishes in the sink.&rdquo;  &ldquo;And of course I just read this where @haleshannon says that all but much better: <a href="http://oinks.squeetus.com/2012/01/in-which-i-gamely-stick-out-my-tongue.html" rel="self">oinks.squeetus.com/2012/01/in-whi&hellip;</a>&rdquo;<br /><br />I find the subject of getting people to read interesting as I had it forced on me as a kid; and being dyslexic I am not sure what else they could do.  At least when I go into my little ones class room they are trying to match up books with readers abilities.  The problem I see is getting an interest in reading without it being a chore.<br /><br />I still find Shakespeare very hard to read, yet it is a must in schools.  I recently worked out the true story of Macbeth after reading a modern translation.  No wonder I found English literature at school so hard if I could not work out the story from the words.  I still find any book that I look up words in the first chapter a disaster.  Also any book with sentences that do not make sense straight away, which is quite easy if you naturally read words wrong and find older english hard work.<br /><br />So while teaching children to read I don&rsquo;t know how to avoid making at a chore for those having difficulties.  Later on during the major exams teachers have a list from the examining board, so another hard time not destroying books.  In-between my only hope is children get introduced to books suitable for their reading level, maturity and interest, so books are not a chore.  As a family we are trying to stop books being a chore for our little one.  My hubbie reads a chapter every available night and she gets the Beano every week (which you can follow most of the stories without reading).<br /></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-480" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title">International Look It Up In A Book Day</h1><div class="blog-entry-date">Tuesday, 17 January 2012 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></div>The Author Philip Ardagh (@PhilipArdagh) wrote on Twitter &ldquo;With Wikipedia off-line on Wednesday 18th, how about 'International Look It Up In A Book Day'?

They had to be the first in a series of books, as if the first book is enjoyed there is more in the series to enjoy. &nbsp;Also fast paced and acceptable for boys and girls as then it is not written with just one type of person in mind and did not get bogged down in a certain scene. &nbsp;We also ignored the ones about to be turned into a film.<br /><br /><br />H.I.V.E. (Higher Institute of Villainous Education) Series by&nbsp;Mark Walden (<span style="color:#0C4698;"><u><a href="http://www.markwalden.net/">www.markwalden.net</a></u></span>)<br />There are at present seven books in this series and another due out next year.<br /><br />As the title indicates it follows a small group of friends who start a new school together. &nbsp;Although this is no ordinary school this is the&nbsp;Higher Institute of Villainous Education. &nbsp;They are meant to be learning how to be villains but they seem to be much better at being loyal and protecting what they believe is important in the school. &nbsp;Which does include practicing what they have learnt in their lessons on anyone in their way.<br /><br />My son particularly likes one character that develops as the series progresses. &nbsp;My son loves computers and so I should not be surprised with his affinity to this one character. &nbsp;But without his friends around him, he would not be able to get up to the high jinks he does.<br /><br /><br />The Demon Lexicon by&nbsp;Sarah Rees Brennan (<span style="color:#0C4698;"><u><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahreesbrenna">@sarahreesbrenna</a></u></span>).<br />There are a total of three books in this series and there does not look like any more being added.<br /><br />This book starts how it means to go on, Alan and Nick defending themselves (and mother upstairs) against a magician (using a demon) breaking into their house. &nbsp;Add in a sister and brother needing help and enjoy the ride into their England.<br /><br />We both enjoy books where one of the lead characters can use a sword and defend himself against anyone attacking him, and Nick has an affinity with knives, actually any blade he can use to protect those around him.  The series of books starts in Devon and they visit several other places around England, so I also enjoyed following their progress around England in my head.<br /><br /><br />Our other favourite choices and why they did not make the top two.<br /><br /><br />Bear Grylls (<span style="color:#0C4698;"><u><a href="https://twitter.com/BearGrylls">@BearGrylls</a></u></span>)<br />This is a must for any child who is a scout (As he is the World Chef Scout) or into Bear Grylls series on television. &nbsp;But I am not sure how the indoor types would enjoy a survival adventure story. &nbsp;We read the second where a plane came down in Alaska.<br /><br />As we were living somewhere where the kids were still expected to play outside at breaks up to -25C at the time, it was just reaffirming what we were learning from the locals, so particularly enjoyable reading a fast paced book where we could understand why the characters reacted the why they did.<br /><br /><br />The film How to Train Your Dragon was so vaguely based on the books by&nbsp;Cressida Cowell that I believe the books should be read whether anyone has seen the film or not. &nbsp;The only things the same seemed to be the title and the main names. &nbsp;After that the film went it's own way. &nbsp;The books are good for the younger audience as there are illustrations all the way through.<br /><br /><br />The Percy Jackson series have also been made into a film. &nbsp;But as a family we really enjoyed reading the books by&nbsp;Rick Riordan at bedtime.<br /><span style="font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; "><br /></span><br />Books by Anthony Horowitz (<span style="color:#0C4698;"><u><a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyHorowitz">@AnthonyHorowitz</a></u></span>)<br />There is news that another short Alex Ryder story may be coming out for world book day in march. &nbsp;Which is wonderful as the teenage spy's books have come to a natural end. &nbsp;The first book was vaguely turned into a film called stormbreaker.<br /><br />Anthony Horowitz has also written the Diamond Brothers series of books which we really enjoyed. &nbsp;Where two brothers solve crimes through their detective agency. &nbsp;They never seem to have much idea of money and the younger one does have more idea on how to solve the messes they get into.<br /><br /><br />The books being read by my son's friends at the moment are&nbsp;Skulduggery&nbsp;Pleasant and the Hunger Games. &nbsp;Skulduggery Pleasant is getting darker as the series progresses (like Harry Potter did). &nbsp;For the&nbsp;Hunger Games here is a lego trailer&nbsp;<span style="color:#0C4698;"><u><a href="http://t.co/uuRKiiKY">ow.ly/83VUK</a></u></span>&nbsp;to give you some idea of the story time for the first book.<br /><br /><br />For those girls into Twilight here are a couple of series to try, complete with the obligatory love triangle.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare (<span style="color:#0C4698;"><u><a href="https://twitter.com/cassieclare">@cassieclare</a></u></span>) writes two series in parallel. &nbsp;The one I prefer at the moment is the infernal devices series starting with Clockwork Angel based in Victorian London where the Shadowhunters/Nephilim defend the world from demons and police the downworlders (warlocks, werwolves, vampires and&nbsp;faerys) and of course themselves from being seen by the mundanes.<br /><br />The Iron Fey series by Julie Kagawa (<span style="color:#0C4698;"><u><a href="https://twitter.com/Jkagawa">@Jkagawa</a></u></span>) starts with the Iron King. &nbsp;It contains the characters contained in Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream and brings there escapades up to date with the advent of us now dreaming about technology.<br /><br /><br />I do hope you enjoy reading in the following year as much as we did during this one.</div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-472" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title">Social Networking</h1><div class="blog-entry-date">Monday, 24 October 2011 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="books" src="books.jpg" width="42" height="40" /></div>Following the idea &ldquo;Justin Somper sets up author training company to allow authors navigate the media and social networking.&rdquo;  It is interesting to see the social networking at work for the latest book by Julie Kagawa (@Jkagawa), the fourth book in the Iron Fey series called the Iron Knight.<br /><br />For anyone interested &ldquo;There will be contests and Q&A and prizes, special guests and exciting announcements, secret reveals and more.

Its aimed at children aged 5 to 12 years old. Wokingham Libraries is challenging children to read 6 books over the summer holidays. The challenge starts on Saturday July 16, so pop along to your local library to get started!&rdquo;<br />Please see <a href="http://www.circus-stars.org.uk/" rel="self">http://www.circus-stars.org.uk/</a><br /><br />If you are under 12 years old give it a go, if you are over, I am sure you can help encourage someone under twelve to have a go.  Sharing reading is always fun and so is reading to younger children (provided they like the book).  I know what my daughter is going after, she has recently got into pirate dinosaurs, but is still madly into mermaids.<br /></div></div>
