Justin Somper was born and raised in St Albans in Hertfordshire. He graduated from Warwick University before going to work as a publicist for Puffin and Random House Children's Books. About 1999 he set up Just So, a PR consultancy focussed on the children's and young adult book market and since then Justin has firmly established himself as one of the leading children's books publicists in the UK. Now living in North London, Justin combines his full-time time PR job with his newly forged career as the author of the Vampirates.
